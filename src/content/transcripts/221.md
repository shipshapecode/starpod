[00:00:00] **Intro:** Welcome to Syntax. Welcome to a brand new episode of the
Front End Happy Hour podcast. Welcome to this week's JS Party. Live from Ship
Shape Studios, this is Whiskey Web and Whatnot. With your hosts, Robbie the
Wagner, and me, Charles William Carpenter III. That's right Charles. We drink
whiskey and talk about web development.

[00:00:27] **Intro:** I mean, it's all in the name. It's not that deep. This is
Whiskey Web and Whatnot. Do not adjust your set.

[00:00:36] **Robbie Wagner:** Hey, what's up everybody? Welcome to a live
whiskey web and whatnot. I don't have a catchy name for it today. cabernet code
and something. Chatter. Chatter

[00:00:46] **Brian Douglas:** It's literally Cabernet.

[00:00:47] **Nick Taylor:** Yeah, I'm, I'm impressed.

[00:00:49] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. yeah. So we are, we are live here. I have my
guest host Nick Taylor. How's

[00:00:53] **Robbie Wagner:** it going, Nick?

[00:00:53] **Nick Taylor:** Not too bad. Doing pretty good. It's been, it's been
a minute. It's been like, what, 12 hours since I last

[00:00:57] **Nick Taylor:** c We've

[00:00:58] **Robbie Wagner:** Yes. Seen a lot

[00:00:59] **Robbie Wagner:** of

[00:00:59] **Robbie Wagner:** each other.

[00:00:59] **Nick Taylor:** Yeah. [00:01:00] Yeah. Yeah.

[00:01:02] **Robbie Wagner:** And our guest.

[00:01:03] **Robbie Wagner:** today is be Dougie.

[00:01:03] **Robbie Wagner:** How's it

[00:01:04] **Brian Douglas:** Uh, I am super, well, I've actually no more talks.
I'm just, uh, eating salty popcorn and, uh, in the Cabernet corner.

[00:01:11] **Robbie Wagner:** Nice.

[00:01:11] **Robbie Wagner:** Nice, nice. Cool. Well, yeah, before we get into
anything else, let's start with some Cabernet. We got some Josh, everyone's a
fan of Josh, just 'cause I, I think it's a silly name to just be

[00:01:22] **Brian Douglas:** Josh,

[00:01:23] **Brian Douglas:** I actually, I'm not familiar with Josh.

[00:01:25] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:01:25] **Brian Douglas:** don't

[00:01:26] **Brian Douglas:** know about his

[00:01:26] **Brian Douglas:** game.

[00:01:27] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I always, uh,

[00:01:28] **Robbie Wagner:** like

[00:01:28] **Nick Taylor:** apparently he brings his game.

[00:01:30] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah. Speaking of games, I will play games with my
friends and like, like, Hey, Josh is gonna join us tonight to play. here, pass
that down.

[00:01:39] **Brian Douglas:** pass that down.

[00:01:40] **Brian Douglas:** Here

[00:01:40] **Nick Taylor:** I, I have never heard of Josh.

[00:01:42] **Brian Douglas:** No. Is this like

[00:01:42] **Brian Douglas:** regional?

[00:01:43] **Robbie Wagner:** It must be, I guess I didn't know it wasn't a,

[00:01:46] **Brian Douglas:** no. Like, does it have a, a winery, like what's
the, uh, location of the winery?

[00:01:50] **Robbie Wagner:** I dunno. Let's,

[00:01:51] **Robbie Wagner:** let's

[00:01:51] **Nick Taylor:** Aside from the location in my cup.

[00:01:53] **Robbie Wagner:** Nope. Got a bunch of my pants.

[00:01:58] **Nick Taylor:** Oh,

[00:01:58] **Nick Taylor:** Josh.

[00:01:59] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, Josh. Yeah. [00:02:00] You're always messing
with my pants.

[00:02:01] **Brian Douglas:** Sloppy Josh.

[00:02:05] **Robbie Wagner:** Okay. Yeah, let's, let's try some. All right, so
I've got a, uh, do you have a toast for us? All right.

[00:02:11] **Robbie Wagner:** Here's the open sauce, the platform that reminded
us, our commits actually mattered even if our bosses never noticed. You helped
us track our GitHub glory and now you're just another repo and the great archive
of acquisitions.

[00:02:22] **Robbie Wagner:** So today we pour one out for all the green squares
and the spicy little startup that made open source. Feel delicious. Cheers to
open sauce. You pushed, you merged, you shipped your legacy. Amazing

[00:02:32] **Brian Douglas:** Amazing.

[00:02:33] **Brian Douglas:** I'm tear

[00:02:34] **Robbie Wagner:** up.

[00:02:37] **Brian Douglas:** man.

[00:02:37] **Brian Douglas:** What a

[00:02:37] **Brian Douglas:** toast. Yes.

[00:02:39] **Brian Douglas:** That

[00:02:39] **Brian Douglas:** was a good

[00:02:39] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:02:39] **Robbie Wagner:** AI's good at making toast if you didn't know.

[00:02:42] **Nick Taylor:** Yeah.

[00:02:43] **Brian Douglas:** Amazing.

[00:02:44] **Nick Taylor:** Yeah,

[00:02:45] **Nick Taylor:** Open

[00:02:45] **Nick Taylor:** sauce

[00:02:46] **Nick Taylor:** was good times.

[00:02:46] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. I don't know if how we're starting this
podcast, but yeah. Nick worked with me at Open Sauce for a good year.

[00:02:52] **Brian Douglas:** At that point you were,

[00:02:52] **Brian Douglas:** you were

[00:02:53] **Brian Douglas:** half

[00:02:53] **Brian Douglas:** the journey. yeah, now the journey is

[00:02:55] **Brian Douglas:** completed.

[00:02:56] **Brian Douglas:** I actually

[00:02:57] **Brian Douglas:** got,

[00:02:57] **Brian Douglas:** I got word that the last person who came over in
the Lennox [00:03:00] Foundation acquisition just, uh, announced a departure
last week. So

[00:03:03] **Brian Douglas:** it,

[00:03:03] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:03:03] **Brian Douglas:** literally

[00:03:04] **Brian Douglas:** is

[00:03:04] **Brian Douglas:** finished.

[00:03:05] **Robbie Wagner:** Okay.

[00:03:05] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. I tried to go to it earlier and it was like,

[00:03:07] **Robbie Wagner:** no. So I was like, oh, that's sad. But yeah. Yeah.
The end of an era.

[00:03:12] **Robbie Wagner:** We may get a little more into that here in a
little bit, but we got some hot takes, which we maybe did with you before you've
been on the show before.

[00:03:18] **Brian Douglas:** Uh, Yeah.

[00:03:19] **Brian Douglas:** Honestly, I

[00:03:19] **Brian Douglas:** still have that

[00:03:19] **Brian Douglas:** bottle. I haven't finished it,

[00:03:21] **Brian Douglas:** so,

[00:03:21] **Brian Douglas:** um,

[00:03:22] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:03:22] **Brian Douglas:** don't remember

[00:03:22] **Brian Douglas:** what

[00:03:23] **Brian Douglas:** we

[00:03:23] **Brian Douglas:** talked about,

[00:03:23] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:03:23] **Brian Douglas:** yeah, the

[00:03:24] **Brian Douglas:** whiskey was

[00:03:24] **Brian Douglas:** good.

[00:03:25] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Yeah. , So yeah, I have a condensed list,
but let's just do a few here.

[00:03:28] **Robbie Wagner:** Get rebase

[00:03:29] **Robbie Wagner:** or get merge,

[00:03:30] **Brian Douglas:** rebase.

[00:03:31] **Robbie Wagner:** Okay.

[00:03:32] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. I like,

[00:03:33] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:03:33] **Brian Douglas:** know, pure history. , But you know, actually I'm
a, I am a squasher,

[00:03:38] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:03:38] **Brian Douglas:** squash first and then rebase. And you always have
historical

[00:03:42] **Brian Douglas:** record merge.

[00:03:43] **Brian Douglas:** Commits are messy.

[00:03:44] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, they are? Yes. Yeah.

[00:03:46] **Robbie Wagner:** The worst is when you're actually squashing and
doing things really clean.

[00:03:50] **Robbie Wagner:** But then. Still merging. So it's like really nice
history of what you actually wanted, but merged, merged, merged. It's like,
yeah, I get ya.

[00:03:59] **Robbie Wagner:** is [00:04:00] H-T-M-L-A programming language?

[00:04:01] **Brian Douglas:** that's a good question. , You do

[00:04:02] **Brian Douglas:** cool things

[00:04:03] **Brian Douglas:** with it.

[00:04:03] **Brian Douglas:** It is a template that

[00:04:06] **Brian Douglas:** you could

[00:04:07] **Brian Douglas:** write

[00:04:07] **Brian Douglas:** in language,

[00:04:08] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:04:08] **Brian Douglas:** natural

[00:04:08] **Brian Douglas:** language.

[00:04:09] **Brian Douglas:** Not even lang. It's not even natural. It's
semantic. Yeah.

[00:04:12] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:04:12] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah. Okay. That's not afraid. There's no right
answer. Yeah. It's just to spark conversation. So then.

[00:04:17] **Robbie Wagner:** Is CSSA programming language?

[00:04:19] **Brian Douglas:** I think it's getting there. You can do some ,
performative things in there. , Not just like animations, but like, yeah, you
can do some cool things.

[00:04:24] **Brian Douglas:** So yeah,

[00:04:26] **Brian Douglas:** I don't

[00:04:27] **Brian Douglas:** know.

[00:04:27] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:04:27] **Brian Douglas:** don't

[00:04:28] **Brian Douglas:** turn

[00:04:28] **Brian Douglas:** complete, like

[00:04:29] **Brian Douglas:** yeah, there's no like zeros and ones or like no
reasoning or,

[00:04:32] **Brian Douglas:** sorry,

[00:04:32] **Brian Douglas:** what's

[00:04:32] **Brian Douglas:** the turn Complete so I

[00:04:33] **Brian Douglas:** didn't

[00:04:34] **Brian Douglas:** get a cs.

[00:04:34] **Robbie Wagner:** I don't,

[00:04:34] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah,

[00:04:35] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:04:35] **Robbie Wagner:** don't,

[00:04:35] **Nick Taylor:** it, it's always the

[00:04:36] **Nick Taylor:** cool thing to say though. Yeah.

[00:04:37] **Nick Taylor:** Something something tur complete.

[00:04:39] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. Non-deterministic

[00:04:40] **Brian Douglas:** and,

[00:04:40] **Brian Douglas:** uh,

[00:04:41] **Brian Douglas:** AI.

[00:04:42] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:04:44] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah,

[00:04:44] **Brian Douglas:** I dunno. You've run outta Chatt BT

[00:04:46] **Brian Douglas:** tokens.

[00:04:47] **Brian Douglas:** Please

[00:04:47] **Brian Douglas:** check

[00:04:48] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:04:48] **Brian Douglas:** back

[00:04:48] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:04:48] **Brian Douglas:** at

[00:04:48] **Brian Douglas:** 10:00 PM

[00:04:50] **Robbie Wagner:** You're

[00:04:50] **Robbie Wagner:** absolutely right.

[00:04:53] **Robbie Wagner:** ,

[00:04:53] **Robbie Wagner:** Okay. Sidebar on the left or

[00:04:55] **Robbie Wagner:** right in

[00:04:55] **Robbie Wagner:** vs. Code.

[00:04:56] **Brian Douglas:** sidebar

[00:04:56] **Brian Douglas:** on

[00:04:56] **Brian Douglas:** the left.

[00:04:57] **Brian Douglas:** Agent,

[00:04:58] **Brian Douglas:** editor thing

[00:04:59] **Brian Douglas:** [00:05:00] on

[00:05:00] **Brian Douglas:** the right.

[00:05:01] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. I've been a, a right side, I dunno, cursor's
like gone back and forth like cursor. I think a lot of cool kids are doing on
the left side.

[00:05:06] **Brian Douglas:** but I do like

[00:05:06] **Brian Douglas:** having

[00:05:07] **Brian Douglas:** my, my

[00:05:07] **Brian Douglas:** file menu on the left. Like

[00:05:08] **Brian Douglas:** I'm just so used to

[00:05:09] **Brian Douglas:** that.

[00:05:09] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:05:10] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. That's the default. And yeah, so I think the
only person who has said the right, like taking the time to move it to

[00:05:17] **Robbie Wagner:** not the

[00:05:17] **Robbie Wagner:** default is Jason

[00:05:18] **Robbie Wagner:** Langsdorf. He's like, this is objectively the
correct answer. Like it is not a subjective choice. And I'm like, no, it, it

[00:05:24] **Robbie Wagner:** is.

[00:05:25] **Nick Taylor:** I, I

[00:05:26] **Nick Taylor:** got bad news. I'm, I'm one of the right side boys

[00:05:28] **Nick Taylor:** too. Oh, are you?

[00:05:29] **Nick Taylor:** The, the main, the main reason why I do it is when
I'm live streaming and you're live coding. It keeps bumping it back and forth if
you open and close it. And if you have it on the

[00:05:38] **Nick Taylor:** right

[00:05:38] **Nick Taylor:** side,

[00:05:38] **Nick Taylor:** it doesn't

[00:05:39] **Nick Taylor:** affect it as much. Yeah. And I,

[00:05:42] **Nick Taylor:** but I also do weird stuff.

[00:05:43] **Nick Taylor:** Like, like I do stuff on purpose to hurt my brain,
so it makes me think, you know, kind

[00:05:48] **Nick Taylor:** of,

[00:05:48] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:05:49] **Brian Douglas:** Uh, you

[00:05:50] **Brian Douglas:** know?

[00:05:50] **Brian Douglas:** I might be tempted,

[00:05:51] **Robbie Wagner:** honestly.

[00:05:52] **Nick Taylor:** All

[00:05:52] **Nick Taylor:** right. You heard it

[00:05:53] **Nick Taylor:** here first. You

[00:05:53] **Nick Taylor:** heard it

[00:05:53] **Brian Douglas:** side,

[00:05:54] **Robbie Wagner:** I agree with that reasoning that it, like, it
doesn't bounce your coat around when you're opening and closing it.

[00:05:59] **Robbie Wagner:** I just [00:06:00] don't open and close it that

[00:06:01] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. So it's like

[00:06:02] **Brian Douglas:** you know, I

[00:06:03] **Brian Douglas:** might be

[00:06:03] **Brian Douglas:** with you.

[00:06:04] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:06:04] **Brian Douglas:** actually keep it

[00:06:04] **Brian Douglas:** closed a lot. Like, unless I'm like, okay, what
happened here again, like, let me navigate. But usually I got a mental

[00:06:10] **Brian Douglas:** model of like where

[00:06:11] **Brian Douglas:** things

[00:06:11] **Brian Douglas:** are or what

[00:06:11] **Brian Douglas:** names are

[00:06:12] **Brian Douglas:** that.

[00:06:13] **Robbie Wagner:** I don't

[00:06:13] **Robbie Wagner:** actually

[00:06:13] **Robbie Wagner:** open. And if you

[00:06:14] **Robbie Wagner:** have more than like 10 files, you're just
searching for 'em anyway.

[00:06:17] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. Like,

[00:06:18] **Brian Douglas:** oh

[00:06:19] **Nick Taylor:** oh yeah, I'm

[00:06:19] **Nick Taylor:** definitely Command P Gang. even though I love Visual
Studio Code, I'm like always using shortcuts. we were talking about this
yesterday, about like people talking about vim and stuff and shortcuts and it's.
I don't know. I'm, I basically, DS code for me at this point is just like
glorified, like terminal editor kind

[00:06:37] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:06:38] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah.

[00:06:39] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:06:39] **Robbie Wagner:** used the, uh, IntelliJ, key bindings,
unfortunately I started out with WebStorm and learned all of that and I was
like, I don't wanna change. I should have changed though, because. Now
everybody's like, oh, hit this thing. And I'm

[00:06:49] **Robbie Wagner:** like, nah, my, my, keys

[00:06:50] **Robbie Wagner:** don't do

[00:06:51] **Robbie Wagner:** that.

[00:06:52] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. And it's a bit awkward. I, I'm a Vim user as
well, and, uh, I've got the Vim

[00:06:55] **Brian Douglas:** bindings, but

[00:06:56] **Brian Douglas:** none of

[00:06:56] **Brian Douglas:** my key

[00:06:57] **Brian Douglas:** bindings and Vim transferred over. Honestly, I

[00:06:59] **Brian Douglas:** [00:07:00] don't

[00:07:00] **Brian Douglas:** even use vs code anymore.

[00:07:01] **Brian Douglas:** I'm in Zed and Neo. Vim.

[00:07:02] **Brian Douglas:** Okay.

[00:07:03] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:07:03] **Brian Douglas:** I go back and forth 'cause ZI

[00:07:04] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:07:04] **Brian Douglas:** no

[00:07:04] **Brian Douglas:** plugins

[00:07:05] **Brian Douglas:** on there. So it's

[00:07:05] **Brian Douglas:** like fast, no

[00:07:06] **Brian Douglas:** bloat

[00:07:07] **Brian Douglas:** vs. Code

[00:07:07] **Brian Douglas:** opposite problem.

[00:07:08] **Brian Douglas:** Too

[00:07:09] **Brian Douglas:** much

[00:07:09] **Brian Douglas:** stuff in there

[00:07:10] **Brian Douglas:** and I

[00:07:10] **Brian Douglas:** don't

[00:07:10] **Brian Douglas:** have the time to go

[00:07:11] **Brian Douglas:** clean

[00:07:12] **Brian Douglas:** it up. Yeah.

[00:07:12] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Yeah. I've been hearing, uh, I think Adam
Argyle, my new, uh, co-host is, uh, using ZA good bit. He's saying it's, uh,
come a long way. 'cause like when I first tried it, I don't know, two, three
years ago or something.

[00:07:25] **Robbie Wagner:** When did

[00:07:25] **Robbie Wagner:** it come

[00:07:25] **Robbie Wagner:** out?

[00:07:26] **Robbie Wagner:** It's

[00:07:26] **Robbie Wagner:** been

[00:07:26] **Robbie Wagner:** a

[00:07:26] **Robbie Wagner:** little

[00:07:26] **Robbie Wagner:** while. Uh,

[00:07:26] **Robbie Wagner:** it, Yeah, it was

[00:07:28] **Brian Douglas:** open

[00:07:28] **Brian Douglas:** source like

[00:07:28] **Brian Douglas:** 2019.

[00:07:29] **Brian Douglas:** Like

[00:07:29] **Brian Douglas:** it was pretty

[00:07:30] **Brian Douglas:** early.

[00:07:31] **Brian Douglas:** It's

[00:07:31] **Brian Douglas:** been

[00:07:31] **Robbie Wagner:** Maybe it's been longer than I thought.

[00:07:33] **Brian Douglas:** because,

[00:07:33] **Brian Douglas:** I,

[00:07:33] **Brian Douglas:** you know,

[00:07:33] **Brian Douglas:** the history of z

[00:07:35] **Brian Douglas:** it's

[00:07:35] **Robbie Wagner:** the, uh,

[00:07:36] **Robbie Wagner:** team

[00:07:36] **Robbie Wagner:** that

[00:07:36] **Robbie Wagner:** built Adam

[00:07:37] **Robbie Wagner:** at

[00:07:37] **Robbie Wagner:** GitHub.

[00:07:37] **Robbie Wagner:** Yes. Uh, and GitHub, you're

[00:07:39] **Robbie Wagner:** jogging

[00:07:39] **Robbie Wagner:** my

[00:07:39] **Robbie Wagner:** memory. We've

[00:07:40] **Brian Douglas:** had

[00:07:40] **Brian Douglas:** guy,

[00:07:40] **Robbie Wagner:** uh,

[00:07:41] **Robbie Wagner:** what's his name?

[00:07:41] **Robbie Wagner:** The guy that,

[00:07:42] **Robbie Wagner:** uh, started

[00:07:43] **Robbie Wagner:** it. I can

[00:07:43] **Robbie Wagner:** see

[00:07:43] **Brian Douglas:** his face.

[00:07:44] **Brian Douglas:** yeah,

[00:07:44] **Brian Douglas:** he was

[00:07:44] **Brian Douglas:** on the

[00:07:44] **Brian Douglas:** show

[00:07:45] **Brian Douglas:** and told

[00:07:45] **Brian Douglas:** us

[00:07:45] **Brian Douglas:** all about it,

[00:07:46] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. Yeah. So this kind of

[00:07:47] **Brian Douglas:** like, had a cool project they were working on

[00:07:49] **Brian Douglas:** and they

[00:07:49] **Brian Douglas:** didn't really

[00:07:49] **Brian Douglas:** take funding until like 20,

[00:07:51] **Brian Douglas:** 22, like

[00:07:52] **Brian Douglas:** kinda later. and like it was at that point it had
so many users, but then they kind of figured out what the product was gonna be
that would make money, don't ask me

[00:07:58] **Brian Douglas:** what it is. I have no idea how they make
money.[00:08:00]

[00:08:01] **Robbie Wagner:** How

[00:08:01] **Robbie Wagner:** does anyone

[00:08:01] **Robbie Wagner:** make money

[00:08:02] **Robbie Wagner:** really

[00:08:03] **Robbie Wagner:** show

[00:08:03] **Robbie Wagner:** up

[00:08:03] **Robbie Wagner:** every

[00:08:04] **Robbie Wagner:** day?

[00:08:04] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:08:04] **Nick Taylor:** I just asked Josh.

[00:08:06] **Robbie Wagner:** Yes.

[00:08:08] **Brian Douglas:** Just

[00:08:08] **Brian Douglas:** look

[00:08:08] **Brian Douglas:** at

[00:08:09] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:08:09] **Brian Douglas:** bottom of

[00:08:09] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:08:09] **Brian Douglas:** cup and that's

[00:08:09] **Brian Douglas:** where the money

[00:08:10] **Brian Douglas:** comes Yep. Yeah. Josh is probably doing okay, I
would think.

[00:08:14] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:08:15] **Robbie Wagner:** Um,

[00:08:15] **Robbie Wagner:** Rails or Laravel?

[00:08:16] **Brian Douglas:** I don't know,

[00:08:17] **Brian Douglas:** Laravel.

[00:08:18] **Brian Douglas:** So I

[00:08:18] **Brian Douglas:** guess rails.

[00:08:20] **Brian Douglas:** like, You

[00:08:20] **Brian Douglas:** don't have to know either. You can just have

[00:08:21] **Brian Douglas:** an opinion.

[00:08:22] **Brian Douglas:** I don't use either

[00:08:23] **Brian Douglas:** of them.

[00:08:23] **Brian Douglas:** Laravel seems really cool. Like they seem to be
cool, like a lot of cool

[00:08:25] **Brian Douglas:** kids

[00:08:26] **Brian Douglas:** are

[00:08:26] **Brian Douglas:** over there.

[00:08:26] **Brian Douglas:** I just don't

[00:08:27] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:08:27] **Brian Douglas:** like the

[00:08:27] **Brian Douglas:** brain power

[00:08:28] **Brian Douglas:** to do

[00:08:28] **Brian Douglas:** another thing.

[00:08:29] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:08:29] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:08:29] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:08:29] **Brian Douglas:** built a

[00:08:29] **Brian Douglas:** couple Rails apps recently just

[00:08:31] **Brian Douglas:** for

[00:08:31] **Brian Douglas:** kicks

[00:08:32] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:08:32] **Brian Douglas:** giggles.

[00:08:32] **Brian Douglas:** Right. Really?

[00:08:33] **Robbie Wagner:** Really? Yeah.

[00:08:33] **Brian Douglas:** see what, what's still

[00:08:34] **Brian Douglas:** there.

[00:08:34] **Brian Douglas:** That was

[00:08:35] **Brian Douglas:** my first

[00:08:35] **Brian Douglas:** sort of framework,

[00:08:36] **Brian Douglas:** honestly. Yeah.

[00:08:38] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:08:38] **Robbie Wagner:** think the batteries included framework model has
gotten kind of lost and now everything is just a react component

[00:08:43] **Robbie Wagner:** of some

[00:08:44] **Robbie Wagner:** sort, cobbled

[00:08:45] **Robbie Wagner:** together.

[00:08:46] **Brian Douglas:** Seriously. Yeah. I mean, Nick,

[00:08:47] **Brian Douglas:** you're a

[00:08:47] **Brian Douglas:** rails person.

[00:08:48] **Brian Douglas:** Like I feel like

[00:08:49] **Brian Douglas:** the AI world

[00:08:50] **Brian Douglas:** leans

[00:08:51] **Brian Douglas:** into

[00:08:51] **Brian Douglas:** like of strong

[00:08:52] **Brian Douglas:** opinions.

[00:08:53] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. 'cause then

[00:08:53] **Brian Douglas:** the agent

[00:08:53] **Brian Douglas:** won't go off the rails.

[00:08:55] **Brian Douglas:** Pun

[00:08:55] **Brian Douglas:** intended.

[00:08:56] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:08:56] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. But I

[00:08:57] **Brian Douglas:** don't

[00:08:57] **Brian Douglas:** know. You're,

[00:08:57] **Brian Douglas:** have you

[00:08:58] **Brian Douglas:** written

[00:08:59] **Brian Douglas:** Rails recently?

[00:08:59] **Nick Taylor:** [00:09:00] Not recently, like when I worked at Dev
two, uh, they were a rail shop and like the thing I found about Rails was the,
to your point about the batteries included and stuff, even though I hadn't
really done any rails until that point, it was very approachable.

[00:09:13] **Nick Taylor:** And

[00:09:14] **Nick Taylor:** the thing is, like you've heard this, at least in
the React world, people have been trying to mimic what Rails does in React land,
like a. I know, like the remix guys, they've been like trying to do that kind of
stuff. And Laravel, I think kind of modeled themselves

[00:09:28] **Nick Taylor:** on

[00:09:28] **Nick Taylor:** like the rails, batteries included.

[00:09:30] **Nick Taylor:** , It's

[00:09:30] **Nick Taylor:** one

[00:09:31] **Nick Taylor:** of

[00:09:31] **Nick Taylor:** those,

[00:09:31] **Nick Taylor:** it depends

[00:09:31] **Nick Taylor:** like, people who like to customize literally
everything. Like it's, it's cool for a while, but like at the end of the day,
you gotta ship stuff and like, making some bespoke react combo of stuff. Like
when we used to have like react boiler templates or stuff, it's like.

[00:09:45] **Nick Taylor:** I don't really care that much anymore. Now I'm just
like, I just need to ship something and this is good enough. You know,

[00:09:50] **Nick Taylor:** like Yeah,

[00:09:51] **Nick Taylor:** I think

[00:09:51] **Nick Taylor:** a lot

[00:09:52] **Nick Taylor:** of

[00:09:52] **Nick Taylor:** people

[00:09:52] **Robbie Wagner:** disagree though. They

[00:09:53] **Robbie Wagner:** don't wanna

[00:09:54] **Robbie Wagner:** ship stuff,

[00:09:55] **Nick Taylor:** they

[00:09:55] **Nick Taylor:** wanna

[00:09:55] **Nick Taylor:** spend two years making

[00:09:56] **Nick Taylor:** that

[00:09:56] **Nick Taylor:** bespoke

[00:09:57] **Nick Taylor:** Yeah,

[00:09:57] **Nick Taylor:** well, well how is you gonna get those zero users,

[00:09:59] **Brian Douglas:** [00:10:00] I

[00:10:00] **Brian Douglas:** know,

[00:10:00] **Brian Douglas:** right?

[00:10:01] **Brian Douglas:** Alright.

[00:10:01] **Brian Douglas:** Or keep

[00:10:02] **Brian Douglas:** 'em. Yeah.

[00:10:02] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:10:02] **Brian Douglas:** honestly,

[00:10:03] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:10:03] **Brian Douglas:** spent all summer

[00:10:04] **Brian Douglas:** building a bunch

[00:10:04] **Brian Douglas:** of projects

[00:10:05] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:10:05] **Brian Douglas:** one

[00:10:05] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:10:06] **Brian Douglas:** them,

[00:10:06] **Brian Douglas:** actually the one I

[00:10:06] **Brian Douglas:** talked about

[00:10:07] **Brian Douglas:** in the keynote, finally has users,

[00:10:09] **Brian Douglas:** not intentionally,

[00:10:10] **Brian Douglas:** it is just more.

[00:10:11] **Brian Douglas:** Uh, I've

[00:10:11] **Brian Douglas:** got a

[00:10:11] **Brian Douglas:** weird

[00:10:11] **Brian Douglas:** following where people

[00:10:12] **Brian Douglas:** actually

[00:10:12] **Brian Douglas:** look

[00:10:12] **Brian Douglas:** at

[00:10:13] **Brian Douglas:** my

[00:10:13] **Brian Douglas:** GitHub.

[00:10:13] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:10:13] **Brian Douglas:** And they're

[00:10:14] **Brian Douglas:** like, oh,

[00:10:14] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:10:14] **Brian Douglas:** saw you ship a thing.

[00:10:15] **Brian Douglas:** Why are

[00:10:16] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:10:16] **Brian Douglas:** looking at

[00:10:16] **Brian Douglas:** that?

[00:10:17] **Brian Douglas:** It's

[00:10:18] **Brian Douglas:** public. '

[00:10:18] **Brian Douglas:** cause I

[00:10:18] **Brian Douglas:** need a free

[00:10:19] **Brian Douglas:** repo

[00:10:19] **Brian Douglas:** and I need

[00:10:20] **Brian Douglas:** free

[00:10:20] **Brian Douglas:** access.

[00:10:20] **Robbie Wagner:** Ah,

[00:10:20] **Brian Douglas:** actions.

[00:10:21] **Brian Douglas:** Otherwise it'd be

[00:10:22] **Brian Douglas:** private. But actions

[00:10:23] **Brian Douglas:** is expensive

[00:10:24] **Brian Douglas:** when it's a private repo. Especially if you

[00:10:25] **Brian Douglas:** gotta run a Mac

[00:10:26] **Robbie Wagner:** os one. Those Things

[00:10:27] **Brian Douglas:** Oh, yeah. Never. Uh, Funny

[00:10:29] **Brian Douglas:** enough, I

[00:10:29] **Brian Douglas:** I was at GitHub

[00:10:30] **Brian Douglas:** when

[00:10:30] **Brian Douglas:** they

[00:10:30] **Brian Douglas:** were, uh,

[00:10:31] **Brian Douglas:** trying to figure out the

[00:10:32] **Brian Douglas:** Maco Westing

[00:10:33] **Brian Douglas:** and it was

[00:10:33] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:10:33] **Brian Douglas:** the trash

[00:10:34] **Brian Douglas:** can

[00:10:34] **Brian Douglas:** Mac

[00:10:34] **Brian Douglas:** time.

[00:10:35] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:10:35] **Brian Douglas:** Uh,

[00:10:35] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:10:35] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:10:36] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:10:36] **Brian Douglas:** legitimately just a bunch of trash

[00:10:37] **Brian Douglas:** cans.

[00:10:38] **Robbie Wagner:** like

[00:10:38] **Robbie Wagner:** the, That's

[00:10:41] **Robbie Wagner:** what it

[00:10:41] **Robbie Wagner:** ran on.

[00:10:41] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. Yeah.

[00:10:42] **Brian Douglas:** That was how it,

[00:10:43] **Brian Douglas:** how we

[00:10:43] **Brian Douglas:** probably got it

[00:10:44] **Brian Douglas:** out there. That's Apple does it too.

[00:10:45] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. All

[00:10:45] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:10:45] **Robbie Wagner:** stuff runs on Mac

[00:10:46] **Robbie Wagner:** Minis

[00:10:46] **Robbie Wagner:** under

[00:10:47] **Robbie Wagner:** desks, so

[00:10:48] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Well, make way more sense,

[00:10:50] **Brian Douglas:** but the trash can thing

[00:10:51] **Brian Douglas:** they can't stack

[00:10:52] **Brian Douglas:** trash

[00:10:52] **Brian Douglas:** cans. Yeah.

[00:10:53] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. The logistics are

[00:10:54] **Robbie Wagner:** harder. Yeah.

[00:10:55] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:10:55] **Brian Douglas:** Well, we come a long way.

[00:10:56] **Nick Taylor:** those, uh, those mac os runners cracks me up. 'cause
like we've [00:11:00] got, like our product is open core, so we've got a open
source repo public, and we have Mac Runners that run.

[00:11:08] **Nick Taylor:** And when, what's the new version of Mac called the
Tahoe? Is it

[00:11:12] **Nick Taylor:** Tahoe? Yeah, it, so like I was doing work and like
my PR was like all the build stuff, steps were passing and then Tahoe got
released and I'm like, what's going on? Like, the builds are failing now. And
like that classic thing that you see on your actual Mac where it says you gotta
update the tools for

[00:11:29] **Nick Taylor:** X code for like get, like that was happening on the
Mac runners

[00:11:32] **Robbie Wagner:** Mm,

[00:11:33] **Nick Taylor:** and I didn't clue in right away.

[00:11:34] **Nick Taylor:** But, uh, so anyways.

[00:11:36] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, that thing is so annoying.

[00:11:38] **Robbie Wagner:** Like I

[00:11:38] **Robbie Wagner:** just

[00:11:38] **Robbie Wagner:** want to

[00:11:39] **Robbie Wagner:** use get, don't make

[00:11:39] **Robbie Wagner:** me

[00:11:40] **Robbie Wagner:** agree

[00:11:40] **Robbie Wagner:** to something.

[00:11:41] **Brian Douglas:** Well,

[00:11:42] **Brian Douglas:** nowadays,

[00:11:42] **Brian Douglas:** like I actually get my agent,

[00:11:44] **Brian Douglas:** so I'll

[00:11:44] **Brian Douglas:** use

[00:11:44] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:11:44] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:11:45] **Brian Douglas:** continuous CLI to basically set

[00:11:46] **Brian Douglas:** up

[00:11:46] **Brian Douglas:** my

[00:11:46] **Brian Douglas:** system.

[00:11:47] **Brian Douglas:** So I

[00:11:47] **Brian Douglas:** had

[00:11:47] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:11:47] **Brian Douglas:** set up

[00:11:48] **Brian Douglas:** tux for me.

[00:11:49] **Brian Douglas:** I've

[00:11:49] **Brian Douglas:** done a

[00:11:50] **Brian Douglas:** couple

[00:11:50] **Brian Douglas:** other

[00:11:50] **Brian Douglas:** things

[00:11:50] **Brian Douglas:** where

[00:11:50] **Brian Douglas:** I, my

[00:11:51] **Brian Douglas:** machine

[00:11:51] **Brian Douglas:** was like

[00:11:52] **Brian Douglas:** taking

[00:11:52] **Brian Douglas:** off

[00:11:53] **Brian Douglas:** all the

[00:11:53] **Brian Douglas:** time.

[00:11:53] **Brian Douglas:** Mm-hmm.

[00:11:54] **Brian Douglas:** Turns out

[00:11:54] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:11:54] **Brian Douglas:** had a

[00:11:54] **Brian Douglas:** docker running,

[00:11:55] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:11:55] **Brian Douglas:** multiple

[00:11:56] **Brian Douglas:** docker images

[00:11:56] **Brian Douglas:** running

[00:11:57] **Brian Douglas:** do it.

[00:11:58] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:11:58] **Brian Douglas:** I was like,

[00:11:59] **Brian Douglas:** Hey,

[00:11:59] **Brian Douglas:** I don't know what's [00:12:00] going on,

[00:12:00] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:12:00] **Brian Douglas:** could you

[00:12:00] **Brian Douglas:** just

[00:12:01] **Brian Douglas:** check to see

[00:12:01] **Brian Douglas:** like what's

[00:12:01] **Brian Douglas:** taking all the

[00:12:02] **Brian Douglas:** CPU usage? I guess I

[00:12:03] **Brian Douglas:** could have opened up

[00:12:04] **Brian Douglas:** the the little, uh, box thing, but

[00:12:06] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:12:06] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:12:06] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:12:07] **Brian Douglas:** you do

[00:12:07] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:12:07] **Brian Douglas:** and, uh,

[00:12:08] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:12:08] **Brian Douglas:** works. So like, I, I honestly don't set up
anything like

[00:12:11] **Brian Douglas:** my

[00:12:11] **Brian Douglas:** vim, my

[00:12:12] **Brian Douglas:** neo vim config was

[00:12:13] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:12:13] **Brian Douglas:** port from

[00:12:14] **Brian Douglas:** my,

[00:12:14] **Brian Douglas:** was Janice

[00:12:16] **Brian Douglas:** Vim from back

[00:12:16] **Brian Douglas:** in the day.

[00:12:17] **Brian Douglas:** Like,

[00:12:17] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:12:17] **Brian Douglas:** had the

[00:12:17] **Brian Douglas:** same template, the same dot files, but

[00:12:20] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:12:20] **Brian Douglas:** I'd never

[00:12:21] **Brian Douglas:** really updated it,

[00:12:22] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:12:22] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:12:22] **Brian Douglas:** was like,

[00:12:23] **Brian Douglas:** take

[00:12:23] **Brian Douglas:** this

[00:12:23] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:12:23] **Brian Douglas:** convert

[00:12:24] **Brian Douglas:** it to

[00:12:24] **Brian Douglas:** neo them. ,

[00:12:25] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:12:25] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:12:25] **Brian Douglas:** took a couple

[00:12:26] **Brian Douglas:** couple tries, but

[00:12:27] **Brian Douglas:** yeah, cleaned up my dot files for me.

[00:12:28] **Robbie Wagner:** nice. nice. Very nice.

[00:12:30] **Robbie Wagner:** Okay. Related to ai, is AI to blame when people do

[00:12:34] **Robbie Wagner:** dumb

[00:12:34] **Robbie Wagner:** shit with it?

[00:12:35] **Brian Douglas:** honestly,

[00:12:36] **Brian Douglas:** it's usually,

[00:12:37] **Brian Douglas:** I'll honest,

[00:12:38] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:12:38] **Brian Douglas:** gave a

[00:12:38] **Brian Douglas:** whole talk

[00:12:39] **Brian Douglas:** on

[00:12:39] **Brian Douglas:** this, which

[00:12:39] **Brian Douglas:** is like, it's

[00:12:40] **Brian Douglas:** literally

[00:12:40] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:12:40] **Brian Douglas:** person at the

[00:12:41] **Brian Douglas:** end of

[00:12:41] **Brian Douglas:** the keyboard.

[00:12:42] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:12:42] **Brian Douglas:** like if

[00:12:42] **Brian Douglas:** you're bad at

[00:12:43] **Brian Douglas:** writing tests,

[00:12:43] **Brian Douglas:** you're gonna write

[00:12:44] **Brian Douglas:** bad

[00:12:44] **Brian Douglas:** tests with ai.

[00:12:45] **Brian Douglas:** If you're

[00:12:46] **Brian Douglas:** bad at

[00:12:46] **Brian Douglas:** documentation or

[00:12:47] **Brian Douglas:** bad

[00:12:47] **Brian Douglas:** at figuring

[00:12:48] **Brian Douglas:** things

[00:12:48] **Brian Douglas:** out

[00:12:48] **Brian Douglas:** or

[00:12:48] **Brian Douglas:** even shipping code,

[00:12:50] **Brian Douglas:** you're

[00:12:50] **Brian Douglas:** probably

[00:12:50] **Brian Douglas:** gonna

[00:12:50] **Brian Douglas:** ship

[00:12:51] **Brian Douglas:** pretty

[00:12:51] **Brian Douglas:** bad

[00:12:51] **Brian Douglas:** code

[00:12:51] **Brian Douglas:** with ai.

[00:12:52] **Brian Douglas:** 'cause

[00:12:52] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:12:53] **Brian Douglas:** when,

[00:12:53] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:12:53] **Brian Douglas:** know

[00:12:53] **Brian Douglas:** what you don't

[00:12:54] **Brian Douglas:** know,

[00:12:55] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:12:55] **Brian Douglas:** you do a better job.

[00:12:56] **Brian Douglas:** sorry.

[00:12:56] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:12:56] **Brian Douglas:** heard

[00:12:57] **Brian Douglas:** a, story of

[00:12:57] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:12:58] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:12:59] **Brian Douglas:** company that a [00:13:00]

[00:13:00] **Brian Douglas:** lot

[00:13:00] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:13:00] **Brian Douglas:** people

[00:13:00] **Brian Douglas:** know

[00:13:00] **Brian Douglas:** about. , And there was an engineer who was like
re-implementing

[00:13:02] **Brian Douglas:** a,

[00:13:03] **Brian Douglas:** programming language.

[00:13:04] **Brian Douglas:** using

[00:13:04] **Brian Douglas:** AI

[00:13:04] **Brian Douglas:** credits

[00:13:05] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:13:05] **Brian Douglas:** they

[00:13:05] **Brian Douglas:** had

[00:13:05] **Brian Douglas:** at the company.

[00:13:06] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:13:06] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:13:06] **Brian Douglas:** pretty fascinating.

[00:13:07] **Brian Douglas:** they

[00:13:07] **Brian Douglas:** don't

[00:13:07] **Brian Douglas:** work

[00:13:07] **Brian Douglas:** there anymore,

[00:13:09] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:13:09] **Brian Douglas:** like, when you

[00:13:10] **Brian Douglas:** just do

[00:13:10] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:13:10] **Brian Douglas:** dumb

[00:13:10] **Brian Douglas:** things

[00:13:11] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:13:11] **Brian Douglas:** that, like

[00:13:12] **Brian Douglas:** why

[00:13:12] **Brian Douglas:** would

[00:13:12] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:13:12] **Brian Douglas:** need a new programming language for

[00:13:13] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:13:14] **Brian Douglas:** this

[00:13:14] **Brian Douglas:** problem?

[00:13:15] **Brian Douglas:** It's like

[00:13:15] **Brian Douglas:** AI

[00:13:15] **Brian Douglas:** can,

[00:13:16] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:13:16] **Brian Douglas:** build

[00:13:16] **Brian Douglas:** something,

[00:13:17] **Brian Douglas:** bespoke for

[00:13:17] **Brian Douglas:** this situation. Like It's

[00:13:18] **Brian Douglas:** probably not the, the right

[00:13:19] **Brian Douglas:** tool for the job.

[00:13:20] **Robbie Wagner:** I dunno, there need to be some kind of disclaimers
maybe because like. People don't think about what they're doing, AI just wants
to

[00:13:28] **Robbie Wagner:** solve the problem. It's not caring if

[00:13:30] **Robbie Wagner:** it's

[00:13:30] **Robbie Wagner:** like

[00:13:31] **Robbie Wagner:** secure or good. It's just like, yeah, all right,
I'm gonna expose all your secret keys because I need to like push 'em up to this
like

[00:13:38] **Brian Douglas:** thing

[00:13:38] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:13:39] **Brian Douglas:** The script that

[00:13:39] **Brian Douglas:** has

[00:13:40] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:13:40] **Brian Douglas:** literally the

[00:13:40] **Brian Douglas:** service

[00:13:41] **Brian Douglas:** token

[00:13:41] **Brian Douglas:** directly

[00:13:41] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:13:41] **Brian Douglas:** the script. Yeah.

[00:13:42] **Brian Douglas:** well

[00:13:43] **Brian Douglas:** I've, I've,

[00:13:43] **Brian Douglas:** got

[00:13:43] **Brian Douglas:** that, but I, I've created rules

[00:13:45] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:13:45] **Brian Douglas:** never do that

[00:13:45] **Brian Douglas:** again.

[00:13:46] **Brian Douglas:** But

[00:13:46] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:13:46] **Brian Douglas:** one

[00:13:46] **Brian Douglas:** thing

[00:13:47] **Brian Douglas:** is

[00:13:47] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:13:47] **Brian Douglas:** when

[00:13:47] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:13:47] **Brian Douglas:** have like

[00:13:48] **Brian Douglas:** 20

[00:13:48] **Brian Douglas:** tests fail because

[00:13:49] **Brian Douglas:** of some

[00:13:49] **Brian Douglas:** legitimate

[00:13:50] **Brian Douglas:** change and like you gotta update the

[00:13:51] **Brian Douglas:** test. AI

[00:13:52] **Brian Douglas:** doesn't really know,

[00:13:53] **Brian Douglas:** well,

[00:13:54] **Brian Douglas:** at

[00:13:54] **Brian Douglas:** least

[00:13:54] **Brian Douglas:** I'll, I'll, pick

[00:13:54] **Brian Douglas:** on Claude.

[00:13:55] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:13:55] **Brian Douglas:** the Claude

[00:13:55] **Brian Douglas:** sonnet

[00:13:56] **Brian Douglas:** model

[00:13:57] **Brian Douglas:** doesn't

[00:13:57] **Brian Douglas:** know

[00:13:57] **Brian Douglas:** to like

[00:13:57] **Brian Douglas:** refactor.

[00:13:58] **Brian Douglas:** It just knows

[00:13:59] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:13:59] **Brian Douglas:** add.

[00:13:59] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:13:59] **Brian Douglas:** [00:14:00] always

[00:14:00] **Brian Douglas:** add

[00:14:00] **Brian Douglas:** screen code

[00:14:00] **Brian Douglas:** around

[00:14:01] **Brian Douglas:** the place.

[00:14:01] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:14:02] **Brian Douglas:** then it'll

[00:14:02] **Brian Douglas:** be

[00:14:02] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:14:02] **Brian Douglas:** okay,

[00:14:03] **Brian Douglas:** 20

[00:14:03] **Brian Douglas:** tests

[00:14:03] **Brian Douglas:** fail.

[00:14:04] **Brian Douglas:** 17

[00:14:04] **Brian Douglas:** are passing,

[00:14:05] **Brian Douglas:** we're

[00:14:05] **Brian Douglas:** good,

[00:14:05] **Brian Douglas:** let's move

[00:14:06] **Brian Douglas:** along.

[00:14:06] **Brian Douglas:** The

[00:14:06] **Brian Douglas:** three

[00:14:07] **Brian Douglas:** are

[00:14:07] **Brian Douglas:** not,

[00:14:07] **Brian Douglas:** they don't, don't, worry

[00:14:08] **Brian Douglas:** about

[00:14:08] **Brian Douglas:** those. Let's

[00:14:09] **Brian Douglas:** just like

[00:14:09] **Brian Douglas:** move forward.

[00:14:10] **Brian Douglas:** I'm

[00:14:10] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:14:11] **Brian Douglas:** what

[00:14:11] **Brian Douglas:** are

[00:14:11] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:14:11] **Brian Douglas:** fix

[00:14:12] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:14:12] **Brian Douglas:** test.

[00:14:13] **Brian Douglas:** make. So

[00:14:13] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:14:13] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:14:14] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:14:14] **Brian Douglas:** rule

[00:14:15] **Brian Douglas:** that's

[00:14:15] **Brian Douglas:** basically,

[00:14:15] **Brian Douglas:** if

[00:14:16] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:14:16] **Brian Douglas:** touch

[00:14:16] **Brian Douglas:** it, make

[00:14:16] **Brian Douglas:** it better.

[00:14:17] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:14:17] **Brian Douglas:** it's actually

[00:14:17] **Brian Douglas:** pretty

[00:14:17] **Brian Douglas:** good

[00:14:18] **Brian Douglas:** because it will actually look

[00:14:18] **Brian Douglas:** at

[00:14:19] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:14:19] **Brian Douglas:** and it's like the

[00:14:19] **Brian Douglas:** first one

[00:14:20] **Brian Douglas:** up. And if like, if

[00:14:21] **Robbie Wagner:** you

[00:14:21] **Brian Douglas:** it,

[00:14:22] **Brian Douglas:** make

[00:14:22] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:14:22] **Brian Douglas:** better.

[00:14:23] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:14:23] **Brian Douglas:** if

[00:14:23] **Brian Douglas:** it's

[00:14:23] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:14:24] **Brian Douglas:** oh,

[00:14:24] **Brian Douglas:** a 17 test pass.

[00:14:25] **Brian Douglas:** Well, if

[00:14:26] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:14:26] **Brian Douglas:** touch

[00:14:26] **Brian Douglas:** it, make

[00:14:26] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:14:26] **Brian Douglas:** better.

[00:14:27] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:14:27] **Brian Douglas:** fix

[00:14:27] **Brian Douglas:** as three

[00:14:28] **Brian Douglas:** tests.

[00:14:29] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:14:29] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:14:29] **Brian Douglas:** it's like, oh, you're

[00:14:29] **Brian Douglas:** absolutely right.

[00:14:58] **Brian Douglas:** like ship the

[00:14:58] **Brian Douglas:** code, dude.

[00:14:59] **Nick Taylor:** Yeah. As [00:15:00] the fries

[00:15:00] **Brian Douglas:** in the bag as

[00:15:02] **Nick Taylor:** long as

[00:15:02] **Nick Taylor:** it's not saying six, seven, that's all like my,

[00:15:06] **Brian Douglas:** oh boy.

[00:15:07] **Robbie Wagner:** All right, so

[00:15:08] **Robbie Wagner:** we're at All Things

[00:15:09] **Robbie Wagner:** Open.

[00:15:10] **Brian Douglas:** Yes, we are. Tell me

[00:15:10] **Brian Douglas:** about

[00:15:12] **Robbie Wagner:** Open

[00:15:12] **Robbie Wagner:** Source

[00:15:12] **Robbie Wagner:** has

[00:15:12] **Robbie Wagner:** influenced

[00:15:13] **Robbie Wagner:** your life,

[00:15:14] **Brian Douglas:** man. Open

[00:15:14] **Brian Douglas:** source.

[00:15:15] **Brian Douglas:** Uh,

[00:15:15] **Brian Douglas:** I don't

[00:15:15] **Brian Douglas:** think I'd

[00:15:15] **Brian Douglas:** be

[00:15:15] **Brian Douglas:** here

[00:15:16] **Brian Douglas:** without open

[00:15:16] **Brian Douglas:** source,

[00:15:17] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:15:17] **Brian Douglas:** back when I

[00:15:18] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:15:18] **Brian Douglas:** just a

[00:15:18] **Brian Douglas:** struggling artist and I'm just kidding.

[00:15:20] **Brian Douglas:** actually mentioned in the

[00:15:21] **Brian Douglas:** keynote, my

[00:15:22] **Brian Douglas:** intro into programming was always

[00:15:24] **Brian Douglas:** copy

[00:15:25] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:15:25] **Brian Douglas:** pasting from

[00:15:25] **Brian Douglas:** stuff I could find in

[00:15:26] **Brian Douglas:** open source.

[00:15:27] **Brian Douglas:** So, so

[00:15:28] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:15:28] **Brian Douglas:** used

[00:15:28] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:15:28] **Brian Douglas:** play a

[00:15:28] **Brian Douglas:** lot of like, uh, counterstrike or um,

[00:15:30] **Brian Douglas:** rainbow

[00:15:31] **Brian Douglas:** Six

[00:15:31] **Brian Douglas:** Rogue Spirit. Like you would

[00:15:32] **Brian Douglas:** mod it and find

[00:15:33] **Brian Douglas:** something

[00:15:33] **Brian Douglas:** on

[00:15:33] **Brian Douglas:** Source

[00:15:34] **Brian Douglas:** Forge.

[00:15:35] **Brian Douglas:** And I

[00:15:35] **Brian Douglas:** was like,

[00:15:35] **Brian Douglas:** oh, cool.

[00:15:35] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:15:35] **Brian Douglas:** copy paste,

[00:15:36] **Brian Douglas:** do

[00:15:36] **Brian Douglas:** something.

[00:15:37] **Brian Douglas:** Or

[00:15:37] **Brian Douglas:** back

[00:15:37] **Brian Douglas:** when action

[00:15:38] **Brian Douglas:** script

[00:15:38] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:15:38] **Brian Douglas:** a thing with

[00:15:38] **Brian Douglas:** flash

[00:15:39] **Brian Douglas:** games, like, oh, copy and

[00:15:40] **Brian Douglas:** paste,

[00:15:40] **Brian Douglas:** do

[00:15:41] **Brian Douglas:** a thing,

[00:15:41] **Brian Douglas:** or MySpace, copy and

[00:15:42] **Brian Douglas:** paste,

[00:15:42] **Brian Douglas:** do

[00:15:42] **Brian Douglas:** a thing.

[00:15:43] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:15:44] **Brian Douglas:** when

[00:15:44] **Brian Douglas:** I decided I

[00:15:44] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:15:44] **Brian Douglas:** actually gonna like, try to build something

[00:15:46] **Brian Douglas:** for

[00:15:46] **Brian Douglas:** real,

[00:15:47] **Brian Douglas:** ,

[00:15:47] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:15:47] **Brian Douglas:** ended

[00:15:47] **Brian Douglas:** up

[00:15:47] **Brian Douglas:** just like

[00:15:48] **Brian Douglas:** taking,

[00:15:49] **Brian Douglas:** existing code

[00:15:50] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:15:50] **Brian Douglas:** remixing

[00:15:51] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:15:51] **Brian Douglas:** into like. making

[00:15:52] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:15:53] **Brian Douglas:** work

[00:15:53] **Brian Douglas:** for me.

[00:15:53] **Brian Douglas:** which

[00:15:53] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:15:54] **Brian Douglas:** didn't know

[00:15:54] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:15:54] **Brian Douglas:** was like,

[00:15:54] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:15:54] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:15:55] **Brian Douglas:** a real

[00:15:55] **Brian Douglas:** thing.

[00:15:55] **Brian Douglas:** People

[00:15:55] **Brian Douglas:** did it all

[00:15:55] **Brian Douglas:** the time. Like stack overflow

[00:15:57] **Brian Douglas:** development.

[00:15:58] **Brian Douglas:** that's

[00:15:58] **Brian Douglas:** how

[00:15:58] **Brian Douglas:** I learned

[00:15:59] **Brian Douglas:** was like,

[00:15:59] **Brian Douglas:** oh,

[00:15:59] **Brian Douglas:** [00:16:00] solve

[00:16:00] **Brian Douglas:** problem,

[00:16:00] **Brian Douglas:** copy

[00:16:01] **Brian Douglas:** and paste

[00:16:01] **Brian Douglas:** and shift

[00:16:01] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:16:02] **Brian Douglas:** into

[00:16:02] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:16:02] **Brian Douglas:** how

[00:16:02] **Brian Douglas:** I can make it,

[00:16:03] **Brian Douglas:** which

[00:16:04] **Brian Douglas:** is

[00:16:04] **Brian Douglas:** perfect for

[00:16:04] **Brian Douglas:** ai.

[00:16:05] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:16:05] **Brian Douglas:** Like

[00:16:06] **Brian Douglas:** I'm

[00:16:06] **Brian Douglas:** a hundred

[00:16:06] **Brian Douglas:** percent like, oh

[00:16:07] **Brian Douglas:** shape

[00:16:08] **Brian Douglas:** of what I wanna do.

[00:16:09] **Brian Douglas:** Read

[00:16:09] **Brian Douglas:** this file,

[00:16:10] **Brian Douglas:** build

[00:16:10] **Brian Douglas:** it again

[00:16:10] **Brian Douglas:** for me, but

[00:16:11] **Brian Douglas:** make

[00:16:11] **Brian Douglas:** it match

[00:16:12] **Brian Douglas:** my design

[00:16:12] **Brian Douglas:** system.

[00:16:13] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:16:13] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:16:13] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:16:13] **Brian Douglas:** is

[00:16:13] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:16:14] **Brian Douglas:** unlocked,

[00:16:14] **Brian Douglas:** uh,

[00:16:15] **Brian Douglas:** where I didn't have a CS

[00:16:15] **Brian Douglas:** degree.

[00:16:16] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:16:16] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:16:16] **Brian Douglas:** able

[00:16:16] **Brian Douglas:** to like

[00:16:16] **Brian Douglas:** just get

[00:16:17] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:16:17] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:16:18] **Brian Douglas:** feel

[00:16:18] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:16:18] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:16:18] **Brian Douglas:** could

[00:16:18] **Brian Douglas:** do

[00:16:19] **Brian Douglas:** something.

[00:16:19] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:16:19] **Brian Douglas:** that's

[00:16:20] **Brian Douglas:** how

[00:16:20] **Brian Douglas:** I've

[00:16:20] **Brian Douglas:** been

[00:16:21] **Brian Douglas:** managing my

[00:16:22] **Brian Douglas:** imposter syndrome

[00:16:23] **Brian Douglas:** ever since.

[00:16:23] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:16:25] **Robbie Wagner:** Nice, nice.

[00:16:26] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:16:26] **Robbie Wagner:** So

[00:16:26] **Robbie Wagner:** you mentioned your talk

[00:16:27] **Robbie Wagner:** a few times.

[00:16:28] **Robbie Wagner:** You wanna give us the, the highlights

[00:16:29] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. So I, I gave

[00:16:31] **Brian Douglas:** two

[00:16:31] **Brian Douglas:** talks.

[00:16:31] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:16:31] **Brian Douglas:** one was about finding future maintainers in the
world of

[00:16:33] **Brian Douglas:** ai

[00:16:34] **Brian Douglas:** focus around like

[00:16:35] **Brian Douglas:** ai, agents are

[00:16:36] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:16:36] **Brian Douglas:** they

[00:16:36] **Brian Douglas:** do

[00:16:37] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:16:37] **Brian Douglas:** really

[00:16:37] **Brian Douglas:** good job

[00:16:37] **Brian Douglas:** of doing things, but that's not

[00:16:39] **Brian Douglas:** always

[00:16:39] **Brian Douglas:** the right thing.

[00:16:40] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:16:40] **Brian Douglas:** we

[00:16:40] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:16:40] **Brian Douglas:** like this a

[00:16:41] **Brian Douglas:** bit

[00:16:41] **Brian Douglas:** of like,

[00:16:41] **Brian Douglas:** it's

[00:16:41] **Brian Douglas:** always

[00:16:42] **Brian Douglas:** an

[00:16:42] **Brian Douglas:** epidemic

[00:16:42] **Brian Douglas:** around

[00:16:43] **Brian Douglas:** open source

[00:16:43] **Brian Douglas:** maintainer and like,

[00:16:44] **Brian Douglas:** people being

[00:16:45] **Brian Douglas:** burnt

[00:16:45] **Brian Douglas:** out.

[00:16:46] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. Like

[00:16:46] **Brian Douglas:** there's

[00:16:46] **Brian Douglas:** not

[00:16:46] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:16:46] **Brian Douglas:** lot

[00:16:46] **Brian Douglas:** of people left over,

[00:16:47] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:16:47] **Brian Douglas:** actually write

[00:16:48] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:16:48] **Brian Douglas:** code.

[00:16:49] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:16:49] **Brian Douglas:** it's even worse now with

[00:16:50] **Brian Douglas:** ai.

[00:16:51] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:16:51] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:16:51] **Brian Douglas:** was like encouraging folks to like write issues,
do pr review, like introduce

[00:16:55] **Brian Douglas:** the human in the loop. Like don't

[00:16:57] **Brian Douglas:** always trust the AI to do everything

[00:16:58] **Brian Douglas:** for you.

[00:16:59] **Brian Douglas:** cause

[00:16:59] **Brian Douglas:** then that's

[00:16:59] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:16:59] **Brian Douglas:** [00:17:00] knowledge transfer.

[00:17:00] **Brian Douglas:** so like

[00:17:01] **Brian Douglas:** once

[00:17:01] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:17:01] **Brian Douglas:** prs merge, the story ends

[00:17:03] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:17:03] **Brian Douglas:** like that's

[00:17:03] **Brian Douglas:** at the point

[00:17:04] **Brian Douglas:** where the story

[00:17:04] **Brian Douglas:** starts

[00:17:05] **Brian Douglas:** where you can

[00:17:05] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:17:05] **Brian Douglas:** go back and be like, Hey agent,

[00:17:07] **Brian Douglas:** let's

[00:17:07] **Brian Douglas:** go read

[00:17:07] **Brian Douglas:** some prs

[00:17:08] **Brian Douglas:** together.

[00:17:09] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:17:09] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:17:09] **Brian Douglas:** told

[00:17:09] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:17:09] **Brian Douglas:** story

[00:17:09] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:17:09] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:17:09] **Brian Douglas:** when I joined

[00:17:10] **Brian Douglas:** GitHub, day

[00:17:10] **Brian Douglas:** one,

[00:17:11] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:17:11] **Brian Douglas:** would sit

[00:17:12] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:17:12] **Brian Douglas:** a room

[00:17:12] **Brian Douglas:** with

[00:17:12] **Brian Douglas:** all

[00:17:12] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:17:12] **Brian Douglas:** people onboarding, and

[00:17:13] **Brian Douglas:** they

[00:17:13] **Brian Douglas:** would teach

[00:17:14] **Brian Douglas:** you how to

[00:17:14] **Brian Douglas:** use

[00:17:14] **Brian Douglas:** GitHub for 90 minutes.

[00:17:15] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:17:16] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:17:16] **Brian Douglas:** had already

[00:17:16] **Brian Douglas:** been like,

[00:17:16] **Brian Douglas:** coding full time

[00:17:17] **Brian Douglas:** at

[00:17:17] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:17:18] **Brian Douglas:** point. So

[00:17:19] **Brian Douglas:** most other

[00:17:19] **Brian Douglas:** engineers

[00:17:20] **Brian Douglas:** are like just doing a bunch of stuff.

[00:17:21] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:17:21] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:17:21] **Brian Douglas:** going

[00:17:22] **Brian Douglas:** to PRS

[00:17:22] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:17:22] **Brian Douglas:** like going

[00:17:23] **Brian Douglas:** all

[00:17:23] **Brian Douglas:** the way back

[00:17:23] **Brian Douglas:** and paginating

[00:17:24] **Brian Douglas:** and then

[00:17:25] **Brian Douglas:** looking at all

[00:17:25] **Brian Douglas:** the,

[00:17:25] **Brian Douglas:** all

[00:17:26] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:17:26] **Brian Douglas:** founders code.

[00:17:27] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:17:27] **Brian Douglas:** looking

[00:17:27] **Brian Douglas:** at

[00:17:27] **Brian Douglas:** the issues that

[00:17:28] **Brian Douglas:** were open,

[00:17:28] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:17:29] **Brian Douglas:** all

[00:17:29] **Brian Douglas:** the incinerated

[00:17:30] **Brian Douglas:** things

[00:17:30] **Brian Douglas:** that I

[00:17:30] **Brian Douglas:** knew

[00:17:30] **Brian Douglas:** about

[00:17:30] **Brian Douglas:** outside, I was

[00:17:31] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:17:31] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:17:31] **Brian Douglas:** looked for those issues.

[00:17:32] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:17:32] **Brian Douglas:** it's like

[00:17:33] **Brian Douglas:** crazy how easy it is

[00:17:34] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:17:34] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:17:34] **Brian Douglas:** see

[00:17:34] **Brian Douglas:** that. when you work at GitHub because it's

[00:17:36] **Brian Douglas:** all

[00:17:36] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:17:36] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:17:36] **Brian Douglas:** repo,

[00:17:37] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:17:37] **Brian Douglas:** nothing's

[00:17:37] **Brian Douglas:** deleted.

[00:17:38] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:17:38] **Brian Douglas:** don't think when Microsoft acquired

[00:17:39] **Brian Douglas:** us,

[00:17:39] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:17:40] **Brian Douglas:** if

[00:17:40] **Brian Douglas:** David deleted

[00:17:41] **Brian Douglas:** anything,

[00:17:41] **Brian Douglas:** it's just

[00:17:41] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:17:41] **Brian Douglas:** there in

[00:17:42] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:17:42] **Brian Douglas:** open,

[00:17:42] **Brian Douglas:** full

[00:17:43] **Brian Douglas:** value.

[00:17:43] **Brian Douglas:** yeah,

[00:17:43] **Brian Douglas:** like storytelling

[00:17:44] **Brian Douglas:** through

[00:17:45] **Brian Douglas:** code.

[00:17:45] **Brian Douglas:** Like,

[00:17:46] **Brian Douglas:** but don't

[00:17:46] **Brian Douglas:** forget to

[00:17:46] **Brian Douglas:** like write docs. If you're

[00:17:47] **Brian Douglas:** gonna

[00:17:48] **Brian Douglas:** vibe code

[00:17:48] **Brian Douglas:** the product,

[00:17:49] **Brian Douglas:** at least write

[00:17:49] **Brian Douglas:** some docs

[00:17:50] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:17:50] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:17:51] **Brian Douglas:** vibe coding can

[00:17:51] **Brian Douglas:** still happen the next time you're in

[00:17:53] **Brian Douglas:** a session.

[00:17:53] **Brian Douglas:** and then this afternoon I get a 45 minute keynote
on continuous ai.

[00:17:57] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:17:57] **Brian Douglas:** I work at continuous my

[00:17:58] **Brian Douglas:** day job.

[00:17:58] **Brian Douglas:** I do DX there. [00:18:00] And

[00:18:00] **Brian Douglas:** the focus

[00:18:00] **Brian Douglas:** is

[00:18:00] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:18:00] **Brian Douglas:** can build, custom agents for bespoke

[00:18:04] **Brian Douglas:** situations. So like if you

[00:18:05] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:18:05] **Brian Douglas:** an agent

[00:18:05] **Brian Douglas:** that just code reviews

[00:18:07] **Brian Douglas:** or if an agent

[00:18:07] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:18:07] **Brian Douglas:** only

[00:18:08] **Brian Douglas:** fixed TypeScript

[00:18:09] **Brian Douglas:** errors

[00:18:09] **Brian Douglas:** and like,

[00:18:09] **Brian Douglas:** make sure

[00:18:10] **Brian Douglas:** your TypeScript

[00:18:11] **Brian Douglas:** files are pristine.

[00:18:12] **Brian Douglas:** Like

[00:18:12] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:18:12] **Brian Douglas:** could build

[00:18:12] **Brian Douglas:** agents for just that

[00:18:14] **Brian Douglas:** thing.

[00:18:15] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:18:15] **Brian Douglas:** whether

[00:18:15] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:18:15] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:18:16] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:18:16] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:18:16] **Brian Douglas:** ar,

[00:18:16] **Brian Douglas:** or

[00:18:16] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:18:16] **Brian Douglas:** don't

[00:18:17] **Brian Douglas:** like, there

[00:18:17] **Brian Douglas:** are

[00:18:17] **Brian Douglas:** things

[00:18:17] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:18:17] **Brian Douglas:** don't

[00:18:18] **Brian Douglas:** like doing. like

[00:18:18] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:18:18] **Brian Douglas:** don't

[00:18:19] **Brian Douglas:** like writing

[00:18:19] **Brian Douglas:** types. Yeah,

[00:18:20] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:18:20] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:18:20] **Brian Douglas:** honestly,

[00:18:21] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:18:21] **Brian Douglas:** would

[00:18:21] **Brian Douglas:** be

[00:18:21] **Brian Douglas:** the any

[00:18:22] **Brian Douglas:** person,

[00:18:22] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:18:22] **Brian Douglas:** the way AI is like,

[00:18:23] **Brian Douglas:** oh,

[00:18:24] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:18:24] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:18:24] **Brian Douglas:** put

[00:18:24] **Brian Douglas:** any

[00:18:24] **Brian Douglas:** there or unknown

[00:18:26] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:18:26] **Brian Douglas:** Is like,

[00:18:26] **Brian Douglas:** that's

[00:18:27] **Brian Douglas:** me.

[00:18:27] **Brian Douglas:** me

[00:18:27] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:18:28] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:18:28] **Brian Douglas:** AI

[00:18:28] **Brian Douglas:** are

[00:18:28] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:18:28] **Brian Douglas:** we're synergistic.

[00:18:29] **Brian Douglas:** but I gotta force

[00:18:30] **Brian Douglas:** AI to be like, no, let's write

[00:18:31] **Brian Douglas:** some types.

[00:18:32] **Brian Douglas:** I have

[00:18:32] **Brian Douglas:** rules around

[00:18:32] **Brian Douglas:** how types,

[00:18:33] **Brian Douglas:** this is how

[00:18:33] **Brian Douglas:** we use types around

[00:18:34] **Brian Douglas:** the project.

[00:18:35] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:18:35] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:18:35] **Brian Douglas:** gave like a 45

[00:18:36] **Brian Douglas:** minute demo

[00:18:36] **Brian Douglas:** that actually kind

[00:18:37] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:18:37] **Brian Douglas:** failed,

[00:18:37] **Brian Douglas:** because

[00:18:38] **Brian Douglas:** we

[00:18:38] **Brian Douglas:** actually

[00:18:38] **Brian Douglas:** shipped

[00:18:38] **Brian Douglas:** some

[00:18:39] **Brian Douglas:** stuff that broke,

[00:18:39] **Brian Douglas:** broke

[00:18:40] **Brian Douglas:** the build.

[00:18:40] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:18:41] **Brian Douglas:** I had to do some ham waving on our hosted thing.
But I showed

[00:18:43] **Brian Douglas:** a bunch

[00:18:43] **Brian Douglas:** of,

[00:18:44] **Brian Douglas:** uh,

[00:18:44] **Brian Douglas:** local stuff. Nice,

[00:18:46] **Robbie Wagner:** nice. nice. Yeah. I hadn't considered like

[00:18:49] **Robbie Wagner:** making

[00:18:49] **Robbie Wagner:** specific agents

[00:18:50] **Robbie Wagner:** to be like, you

[00:18:50] **Robbie Wagner:** just care

[00:18:51] **Robbie Wagner:** about

[00:18:51] **Robbie Wagner:** types.

[00:18:52] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah,

[00:18:52] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:18:52] **Brian Douglas:** is actually

[00:18:53] **Brian Douglas:** very rewarding

[00:18:54] **Brian Douglas:** when you

[00:18:54] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:18:55] **Brian Douglas:** get

[00:18:55] **Brian Douglas:** very

[00:18:55] **Brian Douglas:** granular

[00:18:56] **Brian Douglas:** on that.

[00:18:57] **Brian Douglas:** Where like

[00:18:57] **Brian Douglas:** there's

[00:18:58] **Brian Douglas:** no

[00:18:58] **Brian Douglas:** one at your

[00:18:58] **Brian Douglas:** company that's gonna

[00:18:59] **Brian Douglas:** be

[00:18:59] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:18:59] **Brian Douglas:** oh, I'm the [00:19:00] types grip person.

[00:19:01] **Brian Douglas:** Like,

[00:19:01] **Brian Douglas:** if

[00:19:01] **Brian Douglas:** you're

[00:19:02] **Brian Douglas:** probably gonna

[00:19:02] **Brian Douglas:** get

[00:19:02] **Brian Douglas:** fired,

[00:19:02] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:19:04] **Brian Douglas:** dude,

[00:19:04] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:19:04] **Brian Douglas:** if

[00:19:04] **Brian Douglas:** you spent all your day

[00:19:05] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:19:05] **Brian Douglas:** massaging types

[00:19:06] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:19:06] **Brian Douglas:** reviewing types,

[00:19:07] **Brian Douglas:** like that's not gonna happen.

[00:19:08] **Brian Douglas:** But

[00:19:08] **Brian Douglas:** like for

[00:19:08] **Brian Douglas:** an

[00:19:08] **Brian Douglas:** agent,

[00:19:09] **Brian Douglas:** oh,

[00:19:09] **Brian Douglas:** why

[00:19:09] **Brian Douglas:** don't

[00:19:09] **Brian Douglas:** we

[00:19:09] **Brian Douglas:** just have

[00:19:10] **Brian Douglas:** TypeScript

[00:19:10] **Brian Douglas:** agent?

[00:19:11] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:19:11] **Brian Douglas:** this is

[00:19:11] **Brian Douglas:** how,

[00:19:11] **Brian Douglas:** like when

[00:19:12] **Brian Douglas:** I worked at

[00:19:12] **Brian Douglas:** GitHub,

[00:19:12] **Brian Douglas:** they had specific,

[00:19:14] **Brian Douglas:** knowledge

[00:19:15] **Brian Douglas:** people.

[00:19:16] **Brian Douglas:** Like

[00:19:16] **Brian Douglas:** we

[00:19:16] **Brian Douglas:** had the graph

[00:19:16] **Brian Douglas:** qo, internal

[00:19:17] **Brian Douglas:** GraphQL

[00:19:18] **Brian Douglas:** team.

[00:19:18] **Brian Douglas:** Like that

[00:19:19] **Brian Douglas:** was not their

[00:19:19] **Brian Douglas:** full-time

[00:19:19] **Brian Douglas:** job,

[00:19:20] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:19:20] **Brian Douglas:** they were

[00:19:20] **Brian Douglas:** like the

[00:19:21] **Brian Douglas:** torch bearers of

[00:19:22] **Brian Douglas:** like how

[00:19:22] **Brian Douglas:** GraphQL worked at GitHub

[00:19:23] **Brian Douglas:** or

[00:19:24] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:19:24] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:19:24] **Brian Douglas:** payments team,

[00:19:25] **Brian Douglas:** which

[00:19:25] **Brian Douglas:** they

[00:19:25] **Brian Douglas:** didn't have a

[00:19:26] **Brian Douglas:** payments team, but there

[00:19:26] **Brian Douglas:** were some folks would go other places

[00:19:28] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:19:28] **Brian Douglas:** come

[00:19:28] **Brian Douglas:** back

[00:19:29] **Brian Douglas:** for code

[00:19:29] **Brian Douglas:** review.

[00:19:29] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:19:30] **Brian Douglas:** there were like

[00:19:30] **Brian Douglas:** certain individuals, or when it came

[00:19:31] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:19:31] **Brian Douglas:** like system

[00:19:32] **Brian Douglas:** architecture

[00:19:33] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:19:33] **Brian Douglas:** database design

[00:19:35] **Brian Douglas:** where like

[00:19:35] **Brian Douglas:** when

[00:19:35] **Brian Douglas:** they

[00:19:35] **Brian Douglas:** open

[00:19:35] **Brian Douglas:** an

[00:19:36] **Brian Douglas:** issue,

[00:19:36] **Brian Douglas:** like everyone stops

[00:19:37] **Brian Douglas:** and reads it.

[00:19:38] **Brian Douglas:** Because

[00:19:38] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:19:38] **Brian Douglas:** this is the future of GitHub.

[00:19:40] **Brian Douglas:** Like

[00:19:40] **Brian Douglas:** when we ship

[00:19:40] **Brian Douglas:** GitHub actions, like there was an architecture
design, a long dock, , and a couple issues and

[00:19:45] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:19:45] **Brian Douglas:** couple demos

[00:19:46] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:19:46] **Brian Douglas:** were recorded

[00:19:46] **Brian Douglas:** of like, this is what we're building.

[00:19:47] **Brian Douglas:** Like

[00:19:48] **Brian Douglas:** this is

[00:19:48] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:19:48] **Brian Douglas:** future.

[00:19:49] **Brian Douglas:** Same

[00:19:49] **Brian Douglas:** thing, copilot

[00:19:50] **Brian Douglas:** When

[00:19:50] **Brian Douglas:** Uge

[00:19:50] **Brian Douglas:** Uge

[00:19:50] **Brian Douglas:** is

[00:19:51] **Brian Douglas:** a CEO

[00:19:52] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:19:52] **Brian Douglas:** expo, he left, , to go do

[00:19:53] **Brian Douglas:** in a company,

[00:19:54] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:19:54] **Brian Douglas:** he also

[00:19:54] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:19:55] **Brian Douglas:** the first,

[00:19:55] **Brian Douglas:** it's

[00:19:55] **Brian Douglas:** funny,

[00:19:56] **Brian Douglas:** there's

[00:19:56] **Brian Douglas:** a lot

[00:19:56] **Brian Douglas:** of people

[00:19:56] **Brian Douglas:** who

[00:19:56] **Brian Douglas:** claim

[00:19:56] **Brian Douglas:** to be

[00:19:57] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:19:57] **Brian Douglas:** the p

[00:19:57] **Brian Douglas:** creator

[00:19:57] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:19:58] **Brian Douglas:** copilot

[00:19:58] **Brian Douglas:** or

[00:19:58] **Brian Douglas:** the, the folks who

[00:19:59] **Brian Douglas:** named it and like, that's all [00:20:00] true.

[00:20:00] **Brian Douglas:** It

[00:20:00] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:20:00] **Brian Douglas:** like a,

[00:20:01] **Brian Douglas:** a, team

[00:20:01] **Brian Douglas:** of like

[00:20:01] **Brian Douglas:** six

[00:20:01] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:20:01] **Brian Douglas:** 7,

[00:20:02] **Brian Douglas:** 6, 7.

[00:20:03] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:20:03] **Brian Douglas:** Uge

[00:20:03] **Brian Douglas:** was one

[00:20:04] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:20:04] **Brian Douglas:** kicked off

[00:20:04] **Brian Douglas:** the idea of

[00:20:05] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:20:06] **Brian Douglas:** taking

[00:20:06] **Brian Douglas:** OPI

[00:20:06] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:20:07] **Brian Douglas:** doing

[00:20:07] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:20:07] **Brian Douglas:** thing

[00:20:07] **Brian Douglas:** with

[00:20:07] **Brian Douglas:** it.

[00:20:07] **Brian Douglas:** Mm-hmm.

[00:20:08] **Brian Douglas:** so like

[00:20:08] **Brian Douglas:** when

[00:20:08] **Brian Douglas:** you started

[00:20:08] **Brian Douglas:** doing

[00:20:08] **Brian Douglas:** demos, they

[00:20:09] **Brian Douglas:** were

[00:20:09] **Brian Douglas:** pretty bad

[00:20:10] **Brian Douglas:** demos,

[00:20:10] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:20:10] **Brian Douglas:** they were

[00:20:10] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:20:11] **Brian Douglas:** really interesting

[00:20:12] **Brian Douglas:** and like, there was like

[00:20:12] **Brian Douglas:** interesting story there that

[00:20:14] **Brian Douglas:** you can like

[00:20:14] **Brian Douglas:** stop and listen and learn. So like,

[00:20:16] **Brian Douglas:** , We're losing

[00:20:17] **Brian Douglas:** a bit

[00:20:17] **Brian Douglas:** of that

[00:20:17] **Brian Douglas:** in the

[00:20:18] **Brian Douglas:** AI revolution

[00:20:19] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:20:19] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:20:19] **Brian Douglas:** should,

[00:20:19] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:20:20] **Brian Douglas:** if you're

[00:20:20] **Brian Douglas:** gonna

[00:20:20] **Brian Douglas:** make

[00:20:20] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:20:20] **Brian Douglas:** decision

[00:20:21] **Brian Douglas:** with ai,

[00:20:22] **Brian Douglas:** write

[00:20:22] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:20:22] **Brian Douglas:** down

[00:20:23] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:20:23] **Brian Douglas:** at

[00:20:23] **Brian Douglas:** least

[00:20:23] **Brian Douglas:** the next

[00:20:23] **Brian Douglas:** person's not

[00:20:24] **Brian Douglas:** gonna be very

[00:20:24] **Brian Douglas:** confused on like, why this code

[00:20:25] **Brian Douglas:** is like

[00:20:27] **Brian Douglas:** weird.

[00:20:27] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:20:28] **Nick Taylor:** Yeah,

[00:20:29] **Nick Taylor:** no, you mentioning, well, I know you work at
continue, but you're talking about the agents, so does that mean you guys, I
know you shipped a, a agent runner for like CICD pipelines. When you're talking
about the agents, like the TypeScript agents and stuff, are those

[00:20:43] **Nick Taylor:** subagents kind of like Claude

[00:20:45] **Brian Douglas:** yeah,

[00:20:45] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:20:46] **Brian Douglas:** honestly

[00:20:46] **Brian Douglas:** that's,

[00:20:46] **Brian Douglas:** that's

[00:20:47] **Brian Douglas:** actually the

[00:20:47] **Brian Douglas:** best

[00:20:47] **Brian Douglas:** way

[00:20:48] **Brian Douglas:** to kind of mental

[00:20:48] **Brian Douglas:** frame.

[00:20:49] **Brian Douglas:** This

[00:20:49] **Brian Douglas:** is subagent and Quad. but.

[00:20:51] **Brian Douglas:** Subagent

[00:20:52] **Brian Douglas:** and Quad

[00:20:52] **Brian Douglas:** that you could host and

[00:20:53] **Brian Douglas:** share

[00:20:53] **Brian Douglas:** across your team. So like with Quad, you

[00:20:55] **Brian Douglas:** can host those

[00:20:55] **Brian Douglas:** specifically in your quad,

[00:20:57] **Brian Douglas:** folder, in

[00:20:57] **Brian Douglas:** your repo. but

[00:20:58] **Brian Douglas:** what

[00:20:59] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:20:59] **Brian Douglas:** love about

[00:20:59] **Brian Douglas:** [00:21:00] subagent and quad

[00:21:00] **Brian Douglas:** is

[00:21:00] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:21:01] **Brian Douglas:** they're

[00:21:01] **Brian Douglas:** bespoke,

[00:21:02] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:21:02] **Brian Douglas:** also

[00:21:02] **Brian Douglas:** ephemeral.

[00:21:03] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:21:03] **Brian Douglas:** if

[00:21:03] **Brian Douglas:** I,

[00:21:04] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:21:04] **Brian Douglas:** a refactoring agent in Claude,

[00:21:06] **Brian Douglas:** like I'll

[00:21:06] **Brian Douglas:** delete that all

[00:21:07] **Brian Douglas:** the time.

[00:21:08] **Brian Douglas:** Like

[00:21:08] **Brian Douglas:** things

[00:21:08] **Brian Douglas:** change

[00:21:08] **Brian Douglas:** all the time.

[00:21:09] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:21:09] **Brian Douglas:** like, let's just delete that and

[00:21:10] **Brian Douglas:** we continue.

[00:21:12] **Brian Douglas:** It's

[00:21:12] **Brian Douglas:** less

[00:21:12] **Brian Douglas:** about

[00:21:12] **Brian Douglas:** deletion,

[00:21:13] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:21:13] **Brian Douglas:** it's more

[00:21:13] **Brian Douglas:** about sharing.

[00:21:14] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:21:14] **Brian Douglas:** if you have

[00:21:14] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:21:14] **Brian Douglas:** team,

[00:21:15] **Brian Douglas:** like we

[00:21:15] **Brian Douglas:** talk, we

[00:21:15] **Brian Douglas:** actually

[00:21:15] **Brian Douglas:** work

[00:21:16] **Brian Douglas:** with

[00:21:16] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:21:16] **Brian Douglas:** lot

[00:21:16] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:21:16] **Brian Douglas:** enterprises across

[00:21:17] **Brian Douglas:** multiple teams, like.

[00:21:19] **Brian Douglas:** Most

[00:21:19] **Brian Douglas:** of our

[00:21:19] **Brian Douglas:** enterprise sales is like a hundred

[00:21:20] **Brian Douglas:** minimum, a

[00:21:21] **Brian Douglas:** hundred seats.

[00:21:22] **Brian Douglas:** so your platform engineering, trying to scale AI
within an

[00:21:25] **Brian Douglas:** organization,

[00:21:27] **Brian Douglas:** there's

[00:21:27] **Brian Douglas:** a chance that

[00:21:27] **Brian Douglas:** you figured some stuff

[00:21:28] **Brian Douglas:** out

[00:21:29] **Brian Douglas:** that you

[00:21:29] **Brian Douglas:** want to

[00:21:29] **Brian Douglas:** go into

[00:21:30] **Brian Douglas:** the room

[00:21:30] **Brian Douglas:** and start training other engineers. So like you
build all these other sub agents or what we call 'em, agent workflows,

[00:21:35] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:21:35] **Brian Douglas:** basically say,

[00:21:36] **Brian Douglas:** okay,

[00:21:36] **Brian Douglas:** this is the

[00:21:36] **Brian Douglas:** TypeScript experience.

[00:21:37] **Brian Douglas:** this is if

[00:21:38] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:21:38] **Brian Douglas:** ever have a TypeScript or

[00:21:39] **Brian Douglas:** a JavaScript

[00:21:39] **Brian Douglas:** thing,

[00:21:40] **Brian Douglas:** this

[00:21:40] **Brian Douglas:** is

[00:21:40] **Brian Douglas:** the thing you pull

[00:21:41] **Brian Douglas:** for.

[00:21:41] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:21:41] **Brian Douglas:** then

[00:21:41] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:21:41] **Brian Douglas:** could also make a

[00:21:42] **Brian Douglas:** cho choice of like,

[00:21:43] **Brian Douglas:** oh,

[00:21:43] **Brian Douglas:** we

[00:21:43] **Brian Douglas:** can

[00:21:43] **Brian Douglas:** actually

[00:21:43] **Brian Douglas:** go

[00:21:44] **Brian Douglas:** like.

[00:21:44] **Brian Douglas:** not

[00:21:44] **Brian Douglas:** sonnet, but

[00:21:45] **Brian Douglas:** Haiku 3.5

[00:21:47] **Brian Douglas:** because

[00:21:47] **Brian Douglas:** like it's cheaper.

[00:21:47] **Brian Douglas:** It's

[00:21:48] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:21:48] **Brian Douglas:** much

[00:21:48] **Brian Douglas:** cheaper

[00:21:48] **Brian Douglas:** when

[00:21:48] **Brian Douglas:** you have

[00:21:49] **Brian Douglas:** rules

[00:21:50] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:21:50] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:21:50] **Brian Douglas:** bunch of other

[00:21:50] **Brian Douglas:** stuff

[00:21:51] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:21:51] **Brian Douglas:** prompts set

[00:21:52] **Brian Douglas:** up

[00:21:52] **Brian Douglas:** for

[00:21:52] **Brian Douglas:** your agent

[00:21:53] **Brian Douglas:** being successful.

[00:21:53] **Brian Douglas:** We don't have to use the biggest

[00:21:54] **Brian Douglas:** model all the time.

[00:21:56] **Brian Douglas:** And I think

[00:21:56] **Brian Douglas:** that's

[00:21:56] **Brian Douglas:** our difference between

[00:21:57] **Brian Douglas:** like quad, quad selling models. Like they're
literally

[00:21:59] **Brian Douglas:** a [00:22:00] foundational

[00:22:00] **Brian Douglas:** model. Yeah.

[00:22:00] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:22:01] **Brian Douglas:** they're always gonna

[00:22:01] **Brian Douglas:** push

[00:22:01] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:22:01] **Brian Douglas:** the biggest model.

[00:22:02] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:22:02] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:22:02] **Brian Douglas:** enterprise you

[00:22:03] **Brian Douglas:** might

[00:22:03] **Brian Douglas:** not have access

[00:22:04] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:22:04] **Brian Douglas:** all that. So

[00:22:05] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:22:05] **Brian Douglas:** we can

[00:22:05] **Brian Douglas:** get you

[00:22:06] **Brian Douglas:** getting that same experience

[00:22:07] **Brian Douglas:** on a smaller

[00:22:07] **Brian Douglas:** model.

[00:22:08] **Nick Taylor:** so you support like open ai,

[00:22:11] **Brian Douglas:** Yep.

[00:22:11] **Nick Taylor:** do you do local models too? I

[00:22:12] **Brian Douglas:** local

[00:22:13] **Brian Douglas:** models is

[00:22:13] **Brian Douglas:** how

[00:22:13] **Brian Douglas:** we started.

[00:22:14] **Brian Douglas:** So,

[00:22:14] **Brian Douglas:** uh,

[00:22:14] **Brian Douglas:** our CTO came outta MIT.

[00:22:16] **Brian Douglas:** Uh, he

[00:22:16] **Brian Douglas:** actually went to

[00:22:17] **Brian Douglas:** school with the

[00:22:17] **Brian Douglas:** CEO of Cursor.

[00:22:18] **Brian Douglas:** so graduated

[00:22:19] **Brian Douglas:** same

[00:22:19] **Brian Douglas:** class.

[00:22:20] **Brian Douglas:** But he built a

[00:22:20] **Brian Douglas:** VS. Code extension to make a LAMA work in vs code.
so

[00:22:24] **Brian Douglas:** this

[00:22:24] **Brian Douglas:** predates, copilot, predates, almost everyone.

[00:22:26] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:22:27] **Brian Douglas:** that was

[00:22:27] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:22:27] **Brian Douglas:** the focus for like 18 months.

[00:22:29] **Brian Douglas:** , And

[00:22:29] **Brian Douglas:** then

[00:22:29] **Brian Douglas:** earlier this year we

[00:22:30] **Brian Douglas:** built a SaaS product, you

[00:22:31] **Brian Douglas:** could

[00:22:31] **Brian Douglas:** also bring your own tokens in the, the local
version. but the

[00:22:34] **Brian Douglas:** SaaS product basically

[00:22:35] **Brian Douglas:** gives you a hosted experience. So

[00:22:36] **Brian Douglas:** that's

[00:22:37] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:22:37] **Brian Douglas:** SaaS product that enterprises use.

[00:22:38] **Brian Douglas:** The

[00:22:39] **Brian Douglas:** hub,

[00:22:39] **Brian Douglas:** hub do continue dev.

[00:22:40] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:22:40] **Brian Douglas:** like if you want to deploy

[00:22:41] **Brian Douglas:** this to your, your a thousand

[00:22:42] **Brian Douglas:** engineers across

[00:22:43] **Brian Douglas:** your,

[00:22:43] **Brian Douglas:** global

[00:22:44] **Brian Douglas:** team, distributed

[00:22:45] **Brian Douglas:** team,

[00:22:45] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:22:45] **Brian Douglas:** this

[00:22:46] **Brian Douglas:** would be

[00:22:46] **Brian Douglas:** the product

[00:22:46] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:22:46] **Brian Douglas:** sort of have

[00:22:47] **Brian Douglas:** that data

[00:22:47] **Brian Douglas:** plane orchestration on.

[00:22:49] **Robbie Wagner:** Okay. So

[00:22:50] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm not

[00:22:50] **Robbie Wagner:** sure I

[00:22:50] **Robbie Wagner:** fully

[00:22:51] **Robbie Wagner:** understand.

[00:22:51] **Robbie Wagner:** So

[00:22:52] **Robbie Wagner:** like, is,

[00:22:53] **Robbie Wagner:** it, um,

[00:22:54] **Robbie Wagner:** it's

[00:22:55] **Robbie Wagner:** like if, if you have a team of engineers and they
all want to do a certain [00:23:00] task, like the TypeScript thing you were

[00:23:01] **Robbie Wagner:** talking

[00:23:01] **Robbie Wagner:** about, Yeah. like

[00:23:02] **Robbie Wagner:** they

[00:23:02] **Robbie Wagner:** would log

[00:23:02] **Robbie Wagner:** into

[00:23:02] **Robbie Wagner:** this

[00:23:03] **Robbie Wagner:** hub

[00:23:03] **Robbie Wagner:** choose the

[00:23:03] **Robbie Wagner:** TypeScript

[00:23:04] **Robbie Wagner:** one

[00:23:04] **Robbie Wagner:** and be like,

[00:23:04] **Robbie Wagner:** I wanna

[00:23:05] **Robbie Wagner:** do

[00:23:05] **Robbie Wagner:** this thing

[00:23:05] **Robbie Wagner:** in

[00:23:06] **Robbie Wagner:** that,

[00:23:06] **Robbie Wagner:** or

[00:23:06] **Robbie Wagner:** like, yeah, more than likely you're

[00:23:07] **Brian Douglas:** not

[00:23:07] **Brian Douglas:** even choosing

[00:23:08] **Brian Douglas:** like it,

[00:23:09] **Brian Douglas:** it get kicks

[00:23:09] **Brian Douglas:** off. So

[00:23:10] **Brian Douglas:** unfortunately

[00:23:11] **Brian Douglas:** my

[00:23:11] **Brian Douglas:** demo

[00:23:11] **Brian Douglas:** failed

[00:23:12] **Brian Douglas:** that I

[00:23:12] **Brian Douglas:** didn't

[00:23:12] **Brian Douglas:** get to depart of the code review,

[00:23:14] **Brian Douglas:** But

[00:23:14] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:23:14] **Brian Douglas:** Code Rabbit and CODO are

[00:23:16] **Brian Douglas:** both sponsors here and

[00:23:17] **Brian Douglas:** like you could just

[00:23:17] **Brian Douglas:** like install

[00:23:18] **Brian Douglas:** those

[00:23:18] **Brian Douglas:** code review

[00:23:18] **Brian Douglas:** tools or

[00:23:19] **Brian Douglas:** use

[00:23:19] **Brian Douglas:** copilot off like for face

[00:23:20] **Brian Douglas:** value. But the

[00:23:21] **Brian Douglas:** interesting part about

[00:23:22] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:23:22] **Brian Douglas:** is like,

[00:23:23] **Brian Douglas:** where's

[00:23:23] **Brian Douglas:** that data

[00:23:23] **Brian Douglas:** go?

[00:23:24] **Brian Douglas:** Like

[00:23:24] **Brian Douglas:** if

[00:23:24] **Brian Douglas:** it's a hosted

[00:23:25] **Brian Douglas:** server,

[00:23:25] **Brian Douglas:** your entire code

[00:23:26] **Brian Douglas:** base goes

[00:23:26] **Brian Douglas:** off into the, like the,

[00:23:27] **Brian Douglas:** it's hard to

[00:23:28] **Brian Douglas:** use in enterprise

[00:23:28] **Brian Douglas:** basically. So

[00:23:29] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:23:29] **Brian Douglas:** I have a

[00:23:30] **Brian Douglas:** code

[00:23:30] **Brian Douglas:** review

[00:23:30] **Brian Douglas:** agent

[00:23:30] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:23:30] **Brian Douglas:** basically I have

[00:23:31] **Brian Douglas:** rules on how my

[00:23:32] **Brian Douglas:** code is written

[00:23:33] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:23:33] **Brian Douglas:** the project and

[00:23:34] **Brian Douglas:** how

[00:23:34] **Brian Douglas:** we write

[00:23:34] **Brian Douglas:** documentation.

[00:23:36] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:23:36] **Brian Douglas:** I will have a

[00:23:37] **Brian Douglas:** code review

[00:23:37] **Brian Douglas:** agent

[00:23:38] **Brian Douglas:** workflow

[00:23:39] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:23:39] **Brian Douglas:** kicks

[00:23:39] **Brian Douglas:** off

[00:23:39] **Brian Douglas:** every time the PR

[00:23:40] **Brian Douglas:** opens.

[00:23:41] **Brian Douglas:** So it's

[00:23:42] **Brian Douglas:** funny

[00:23:42] **Brian Douglas:** 'cause

[00:23:42] **Brian Douglas:** I didn't

[00:23:42] **Brian Douglas:** get

[00:23:42] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:23:42] **Brian Douglas:** this part, but my entire talk

[00:23:43] **Brian Douglas:** was gonna talked about the get up action

[00:23:45] **Brian Douglas:** workflow that this kicks off

[00:23:47] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:23:47] **Brian Douglas:** agent.

[00:23:48] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:23:48] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:23:48] **Brian Douglas:** way

[00:23:48] **Brian Douglas:** we power this

[00:23:49] **Brian Douglas:** is

[00:23:49] **Brian Douglas:** through our CLI.

[00:23:49] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:23:49] **Brian Douglas:** just

[00:23:50] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:23:50] **Brian Douglas:** quad code

[00:23:51] **Brian Douglas:** ACL

[00:23:51] **Brian Douglas:** I.

[00:23:52] **Brian Douglas:** But

[00:23:52] **Brian Douglas:** RCI

[00:23:53] **Brian Douglas:** is that

[00:23:53] **Brian Douglas:** not

[00:23:53] **Brian Douglas:** just

[00:23:53] **Brian Douglas:** meant

[00:23:54] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:23:54] **Brian Douglas:** like deliver for the

[00:23:55] **Brian Douglas:** agent,

[00:23:56] **Brian Douglas:** give an experience, it's

[00:23:57] **Brian Douglas:** meant

[00:23:57] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:23:57] **Brian Douglas:** really just give

[00:23:58] **Brian Douglas:** you a custom bespoke config. so

[00:23:59] **Brian Douglas:** then [00:24:00] you

[00:24:00] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:24:00] **Brian Douglas:** like rules

[00:24:00] **Brian Douglas:** for your

[00:24:01] **Brian Douglas:** specific

[00:24:01] **Brian Douglas:** situation. So

[00:24:02] **Brian Douglas:** I'll,

[00:24:02] **Brian Douglas:** I'll land the plane

[00:24:03] **Brian Douglas:** with,

[00:24:04] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:24:04] **Brian Douglas:** Germany

[00:24:05] **Brian Douglas:** they have

[00:24:05] **Brian Douglas:** car

[00:24:05] **Brian Douglas:** manufacturers that

[00:24:06] **Brian Douglas:** use continue.

[00:24:07] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:24:08] **Brian Douglas:** the reason

[00:24:08] **Brian Douglas:** why it's

[00:24:08] **Brian Douglas:** important

[00:24:09] **Brian Douglas:** for

[00:24:09] **Brian Douglas:** them

[00:24:09] **Brian Douglas:** is they

[00:24:09] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:24:09] **Brian Douglas:** specific

[00:24:10] **Brian Douglas:** bespoke language

[00:24:11] **Brian Douglas:** that runs

[00:24:12] **Brian Douglas:** on your

[00:24:12] **Brian Douglas:** computer

[00:24:13] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:24:13] **Brian Douglas:** your

[00:24:13] **Brian Douglas:** Mercedes.

[00:24:14] **Brian Douglas:** Oh, sorry,

[00:24:14] **Brian Douglas:** But

[00:24:15] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:24:15] **Brian Douglas:** runs on your

[00:24:16] **Brian Douglas:** computer

[00:24:16] **Brian Douglas:** in in your your your luxury,

[00:24:19] **Brian Douglas:** luxury

[00:24:19] **Brian Douglas:** car

[00:24:19] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:24:19] **Brian Douglas:** unknown noise. Yeah.

[00:24:21] **Brian Douglas:** Whatever

[00:24:21] **Brian Douglas:** car. Who knows what

[00:24:22] **Brian Douglas:** German

[00:24:23] **Brian Douglas:** luxury

[00:24:24] **Brian Douglas:** brands there are, But

[00:24:24] **Brian Douglas:** basically

[00:24:25] **Brian Douglas:** those languages

[00:24:26] **Brian Douglas:** that car

[00:24:27] **Brian Douglas:** manufacturers use

[00:24:28] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:24:28] **Brian Douglas:** to be me, like,

[00:24:29] **Brian Douglas:** no

[00:24:29] **Brian Douglas:** memory.

[00:24:30] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:24:30] **Brian Douglas:** it's

[00:24:30] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:24:30] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:24:30] **Brian Douglas:** language

[00:24:31] **Brian Douglas:** that's

[00:24:31] **Brian Douglas:** not

[00:24:31] **Brian Douglas:** trained on cursor, it's

[00:24:32] **Brian Douglas:** not

[00:24:32] **Brian Douglas:** trained

[00:24:33] **Brian Douglas:** in copilot.

[00:24:34] **Brian Douglas:** It's bespoke.

[00:24:34] **Brian Douglas:** Has to run

[00:24:35] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:24:35] **Brian Douglas:** your

[00:24:35] **Brian Douglas:** own

[00:24:35] **Brian Douglas:** models, your own training.

[00:24:37] **Brian Douglas:** Okay. We

[00:24:37] **Brian Douglas:** work

[00:24:37] **Brian Douglas:** with that

[00:24:38] **Brian Douglas:** situation. So if

[00:24:39] **Brian Douglas:** you're

[00:24:39] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:24:39] **Brian Douglas:** okay, memory safe,

[00:24:41] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:24:41] **Brian Douglas:** all

[00:24:41] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:24:41] **Brian Douglas:** stuff

[00:24:42] **Brian Douglas:** that's

[00:24:42] **Brian Douglas:** like very specific to

[00:24:43] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:24:43] **Brian Douglas:** cars

[00:24:43] **Brian Douglas:** need

[00:24:44] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:24:44] **Brian Douglas:** run a hundred miles or

[00:24:44] **Brian Douglas:** an hour

[00:24:45] **Brian Douglas:** or a

[00:24:45] **Brian Douglas:** hundred

[00:24:45] **Brian Douglas:** kilometers

[00:24:46] **Brian Douglas:** an hour

[00:24:46] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:24:47] **Brian Douglas:** not

[00:24:47] **Brian Douglas:** crash.

[00:24:48] **Brian Douglas:** Like

[00:24:48] **Brian Douglas:** you cannot

[00:24:48] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:24:49] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:24:49] **Brian Douglas:** stack

[00:24:49] **Brian Douglas:** overflow

[00:26:34] **Brian Douglas:** we

[00:26:34] **Brian Douglas:** found.

[00:26:35] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:29:12] **Brian Douglas:** salty.

[00:29:12] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:29:12] **Brian Douglas:** don't

[00:29:12] **Brian Douglas:** know

[00:29:12] **Brian Douglas:** if

[00:29:12] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:29:12] **Brian Douglas:** got like

[00:29:13] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:29:13] **Brian Douglas:** bottom

[00:29:13] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:29:13] **Brian Douglas:** the batch,

[00:29:14] **Brian Douglas:** but, man,

[00:29:14] **Nick Taylor:** Okay,

[00:29:16] **Brian Douglas:** it was good

[00:29:16] **Brian Douglas:** though. I,

[00:29:16] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:29:16] **Brian Douglas:** needed

[00:29:17] **Brian Douglas:** it.

[00:29:17] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:29:17] **Brian Douglas:** didn't

[00:29:17] **Brian Douglas:** do lunch.

[00:29:18] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:29:20] **Brian Douglas:** and uh,

[00:29:21] **Brian Douglas:** sandwiches. Yeah.

[00:29:21] **Robbie Wagner:** I, uh, remembered about lunch when they were like
pushing all of the lunch away on

[00:29:26] **Robbie Wagner:** carts as fast

[00:29:26] **Robbie Wagner:** as

[00:29:27] **Robbie Wagner:** they could. I was like, I'm gonna just skip that.

[00:29:29] **Brian Douglas:** yeah.

[00:29:29] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:29:29] **Brian Douglas:** don't know if

[00:29:30] **Brian Douglas:** this is

[00:29:35] **Nick Taylor:** Yeah.

[00:29:35] **Brian Douglas:** Oh, Yeah. Yeah. They're like cleaning up stuff,

[00:29:36] **Brian Douglas:** putting stuff away,

[00:29:37] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:29:37] **Brian Douglas:** Hey, I

[00:29:38] **Brian Douglas:** wanted that

[00:29:38] **Brian Douglas:** sticker. Like, where's that

[00:29:39] **Brian Douglas:** going?

[00:29:40] **Nick Taylor:** Yeah, I, I gotta say though, shout out to Todd Lewis
and the whole crew here. 'cause this is my second year. I was at the AI one too,
uh, in March. But like, they run a tight ship. Like it's, it's really well
executed. Like I get my talk just before this and the AV people just came in.
They're like, boom, set up lights.

[00:29:58] **Nick Taylor:** They're like, I

[00:29:58] **Nick Taylor:** said, uh,

[00:29:59] **Nick Taylor:** there's

[00:30:04] **Brian Douglas:** Shout

[00:30:04] **Brian Douglas:** out

[00:30:05] **Brian Douglas:** to white mode

[00:30:05] **Brian Douglas:** too

[00:30:05] **Brian Douglas:** as well. I

[00:30:06] **Brian Douglas:** love

[00:30:06] **Brian Douglas:** this,

[00:30:06] **Brian Douglas:** this

[00:30:07] **Brian Douglas:** community.

[00:30:07] **Brian Douglas:** 'cause I, I

[00:30:07] **Brian Douglas:** tell everyone

[00:30:08] **Brian Douglas:** before

[00:30:08] **Brian Douglas:** my talk, like,

[00:30:09] **Brian Douglas:** Hey,

[00:30:11] **Brian Douglas:** is

[00:30:11] **Brian Douglas:** your

[00:30:11] **Brian Douglas:** time.

[00:30:11] **Brian Douglas:** You

[00:30:11] **Brian Douglas:** could

[00:30:11] **Brian Douglas:** have like

[00:30:12] **Brian Douglas:** literally bounced and

[00:30:13] **Brian Douglas:** like did

[00:30:13] **Brian Douglas:** something else cooler than

[00:30:14] **Brian Douglas:** listening to AI talk. one

[00:30:16] **Brian Douglas:** of the,

[00:30:16] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:30:17] **Brian Douglas:** attendees

[00:30:17] **Brian Douglas:** actually

[00:30:17] **Brian Douglas:** shouted

[00:30:18] **Brian Douglas:** out and like, Hey,

[00:30:18] **Brian Douglas:** switch

[00:30:18] **Brian Douglas:** to light

[00:30:19] **Brian Douglas:** mode.

[00:30:19] **Brian Douglas:** 'cause the,

[00:30:20] **Brian Douglas:** uh,

[00:30:20] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:30:20] **Brian Douglas:** room

[00:30:20] **Robbie Wagner:** was

[00:30:21] **Robbie Wagner:** so

[00:30:21] **Brian Douglas:** I didn't realize

[00:30:21] **Brian Douglas:** how bright it would be.

[00:30:22] **Brian Douglas:** and I had

[00:30:23] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:30:23] **Brian Douglas:** figure

[00:30:23] **Brian Douglas:** out

[00:30:23] **Brian Douglas:** how to change the

[00:30:24] **Brian Douglas:** light

[00:30:24] **Brian Douglas:** mode. 'cause like, who uses that anymore?

[00:30:26] **Brian Douglas:** oh dude. Yeah.

[00:30:26] **Brian Douglas:** I don't, I

[00:30:27] **Robbie Wagner:** mean, I, I said everything to dark. Sometimes I'll
like do it based

[00:30:31] **Robbie Wagner:** on

[00:30:32] **Robbie Wagner:** the time of day,

[00:30:32] **Robbie Wagner:** but

[00:30:33] **Robbie Wagner:** like.

[00:30:33] **Robbie Wagner:** It's usually

[00:30:34] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:30:34] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:30:35] **Brian Douglas:** used

[00:30:35] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:30:35] **Brian Douglas:** do

[00:30:35] **Brian Douglas:** that,

[00:30:35] **Brian Douglas:** for, uh,

[00:30:36] **Brian Douglas:** GitHub. I would switch

[00:30:37] **Brian Douglas:** to light

[00:30:37] **Brian Douglas:** mode,

[00:30:37] **Brian Douglas:** in the

[00:30:38] **Brian Douglas:** daytime

[00:30:38] **Brian Douglas:** and then dark mode.

[00:30:39] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:30:39] **Brian Douglas:** actually had.

[00:30:41] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:30:41] **Brian Douglas:** forgot

[00:30:41] **Brian Douglas:** what

[00:30:41] **Brian Douglas:** plugin

[00:30:41] **Brian Douglas:** it was,

[00:30:42] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:30:42] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:30:42] **Brian Douglas:** would

[00:30:42] **Brian Douglas:** change

[00:30:42] **Brian Douglas:** your,

[00:30:43] **Brian Douglas:** your

[00:30:43] **Brian Douglas:** system.

[00:30:44] **Brian Douglas:** dark

[00:30:44] **Brian Douglas:** mode. the light

[00:30:44] **Brian Douglas:** mode

[00:30:44] **Brian Douglas:** based on the time

[00:30:45] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:30:45] **Brian Douglas:** day.

[00:30:45] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:30:45] **Brian Douglas:** don't think

[00:30:46] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:30:46] **Brian Douglas:** actually works

[00:30:46] **Brian Douglas:** anymore.

[00:30:47] **Brian Douglas:** I, it's

[00:30:48] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:30:48] **Brian Douglas:** too

[00:30:48] **Brian Douglas:** many

[00:30:48] **Brian Douglas:** versions of Mac os uh,

[00:30:50] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Yeah. A

[00:30:51] **Robbie Wagner:** lot of

[00:30:51] **Robbie Wagner:** private

[00:30:51] **Robbie Wagner:** APIs

[00:30:52] **Robbie Wagner:** there

[00:30:52] **Robbie Wagner:** probably,

[00:30:53] **Robbie Wagner:** but uh, no. I'm gonna buy

[00:30:54] **Robbie Wagner:** code

[00:30:55] **Robbie Wagner:** that.

[00:30:55] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, Yeah.

[00:30:56] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:30:56] **Robbie Wagner:** And

[00:30:56] **Robbie Wagner:** Apple script.

[00:30:57] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh man.

[00:30:58] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. I just

[00:30:59] **Nick Taylor:** yeah, [00:31:00]

[00:31:00] **Robbie Wagner:** a

[00:31:00] **Robbie Wagner:** thing one time. you run bootcamp before, I assume
on a Mac where you can run windows.

[00:31:04] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, in, on the Windows side
you can just click the little thing and like restart into Mac os

[00:31:09] **Robbie Wagner:** Easily.

[00:31:10] **Robbie Wagner:** But on Mac os it's like you gotta go into
settings, you gotta change your startup dis you gotta press all these buttons.
You gotta put in your password. You gotta like, it won't just let you restart.

[00:31:18] **Robbie Wagner:** So I wrote a little like automation script thing
that like clicked all

[00:31:21] **Robbie Wagner:** that

[00:31:22] **Nick Taylor:** nice.

[00:31:22] **Robbie Wagner:** a thing in the menu bar

[00:31:23] **Robbie Wagner:** to do it.

[00:31:24] **Robbie Wagner:** But

[00:31:24] **Robbie Wagner:** it

[00:31:24] **Robbie Wagner:** stopped working

[00:31:25] **Robbie Wagner:** after like a day. It did not, yeah. Very

[00:31:27] **Robbie Wagner:** unreliable.

[00:31:28] **Robbie Wagner:** That's

[00:31:29] **Robbie Wagner:** how I write

[00:31:29] **Robbie Wagner:** software.

[00:31:30] **Robbie Wagner:** I why? Yeah,

[00:31:32] **Nick Taylor:** Consistently unreliable.

[00:31:33] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah.

[00:31:34] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah.

[00:31:36] **Robbie Wagner:** So you tweeted that, I'm convinced there will not
be a clear winner in the new AI coding era. Just a lot of happy devs getting new
toys all

[00:31:43] **Robbie Wagner:** the

[00:31:43] **Robbie Wagner:** time.

[00:31:44] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm curious what

[00:31:45] **Robbie Wagner:** makes you say that you don't

[00:31:46] **Robbie Wagner:** think someone will win

[00:31:47] **Robbie Wagner:** and, everyone else will fall by

[00:31:48] **Robbie Wagner:** the

[00:31:48] **Robbie Wagner:** wayside?

[00:31:49] **Brian Douglas:** No, I,

[00:31:49] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:31:50] **Brian Douglas:** think who takes

[00:31:50] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:31:50] **Brian Douglas:** most

[00:31:50] **Brian Douglas:** money

[00:31:51] **Brian Douglas:** will win.

[00:31:51] **Brian Douglas:** I,

[00:31:51] **Brian Douglas:** think

[00:31:52] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:31:52] **Brian Douglas:** opening eyes is like, what a bazillion dollar
company and like a cursor took

[00:31:55] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:31:55] **Brian Douglas:** $900 million round.

[00:31:57] **Brian Douglas:** but it doesn't promise

[00:31:58] **Brian Douglas:** people to

[00:31:58] **Brian Douglas:** be like

[00:31:59] **Brian Douglas:** [00:32:00] actual winners.

[00:32:00] **Brian Douglas:** ,

[00:32:00] **Brian Douglas:** It just

[00:32:00] **Brian Douglas:** gives

[00:32:01] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:32:01] **Brian Douglas:** lot of momentum

[00:32:01] **Brian Douglas:** into

[00:32:02] **Brian Douglas:** their

[00:32:02] **Brian Douglas:** camp.

[00:32:02] **Brian Douglas:** but I actually tweeted that because

[00:32:04] **Brian Douglas:** I think,

[00:32:04] **Brian Douglas:** uh,

[00:32:04] **Brian Douglas:** it was

[00:32:04] **Brian Douglas:** like the week that

[00:32:05] **Brian Douglas:** GitHub announced a bunch of stuff and then

[00:32:06] **Brian Douglas:** OpenAI

[00:32:08] **Brian Douglas:** announced

[00:32:08] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:32:08] **Brian Douglas:** Codex

[00:32:08] **Brian Douglas:** model

[00:32:09] **Brian Douglas:** for

[00:32:09] **Brian Douglas:** Their Codex

[00:32:09] **Brian Douglas:** product

[00:32:10] **Brian Douglas:** as well.

[00:32:10] **Brian Douglas:** SONET four five,

[00:32:11] **Brian Douglas:** shipped, and

[00:32:12] **Brian Douglas:** then a

[00:32:12] **Brian Douglas:** bunch

[00:32:12] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:32:12] **Brian Douglas:** other

[00:32:12] **Brian Douglas:** stuff like

[00:32:12] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:32:13] **Brian Douglas:** was a week before

[00:32:13] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:32:13] **Brian Douglas:** Granite

[00:32:14] **Brian Douglas:** four

[00:32:14] **Brian Douglas:** models launch.

[00:32:15] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:32:16] **Brian Douglas:** when it

[00:32:16] **Brian Douglas:** comes

[00:32:16] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:32:16] **Brian Douglas:** models

[00:32:17] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:32:17] **Brian Douglas:** tools, I

[00:32:17] **Brian Douglas:** think

[00:32:17] **Brian Douglas:** that we're

[00:32:18] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:32:18] **Brian Douglas:** we're

[00:32:18] **Brian Douglas:** good.

[00:32:19] **Brian Douglas:** Like there's so

[00:32:19] **Brian Douglas:** many

[00:32:19] **Brian Douglas:** cool

[00:32:20] **Brian Douglas:** things around like.

[00:32:21] **Brian Douglas:** Ai.

[00:32:22] **Brian Douglas:** So like,

[00:32:22] **Brian Douglas:** if

[00:32:22] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:32:22] **Brian Douglas:** don't want do it in the

[00:32:23] **Brian Douglas:** command line,

[00:32:23] **Brian Douglas:** What was

[00:32:23] **Brian Douglas:** it? Sculptor

[00:32:24] **Brian Douglas:** came out

[00:32:24] **Brian Douglas:** a couple

[00:32:25] **Brian Douglas:** weeks

[00:32:25] **Brian Douglas:** ago.

[00:32:25] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:32:25] **Brian Douglas:** then

[00:32:25] **Brian Douglas:** there's

[00:32:25] **Brian Douglas:** also the, uh,

[00:32:26] **Brian Douglas:** conductor.

[00:32:27] **Robbie Wagner:** That sounds

[00:32:28] **Nick Taylor:** Yeah, I haven't heard of

[00:32:28] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:32:29] **Brian Douglas:** sculptor is

[00:32:29] **Brian Douglas:** like extremely

[00:32:30] **Brian Douglas:** new.

[00:32:30] **Brian Douglas:** It's a

[00:32:30] **Brian Douglas:** company

[00:32:30] **Brian Douglas:** that like

[00:32:31] **Brian Douglas:** raised $200 million

[00:32:32] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:32:32] **Brian Douglas:** train

[00:32:32] **Brian Douglas:** models

[00:32:33] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:32:33] **Brian Douglas:** then they're

[00:32:33] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:32:34] **Brian Douglas:** entry

[00:32:34] **Brian Douglas:** point into the

[00:32:35] **Brian Douglas:** market.

[00:32:35] **Brian Douglas:** Is This like

[00:32:36] **Brian Douglas:** really

[00:32:37] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:32:37] **Brian Douglas:** Nice.

[00:32:38] **Brian Douglas:** experience

[00:32:38] **Brian Douglas:** when it comes to

[00:32:39] **Brian Douglas:** like UIs for like interacting

[00:32:40] **Brian Douglas:** with

[00:32:40] **Brian Douglas:** Quad code? But

[00:32:41] **Brian Douglas:** then

[00:32:41] **Brian Douglas:** like.

[00:32:42] **Brian Douglas:** all

[00:32:42] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:32:42] **Brian Douglas:** tools are out

[00:32:43] **Brian Douglas:** there,

[00:32:43] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:32:43] **Brian Douglas:** we

[00:32:43] **Brian Douglas:** could just

[00:32:43] **Brian Douglas:** leverage

[00:32:44] **Brian Douglas:** them. And a lot of them are

[00:32:45] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:32:45] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:32:45] **Brian Douglas:** gotta pay for some

[00:32:46] **Brian Douglas:** stuff.

[00:32:46] **Brian Douglas:** But

[00:32:46] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:32:47] **Brian Douglas:** a lot

[00:32:47] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:32:47] **Brian Douglas:** it's like

[00:32:47] **Brian Douglas:** shockingly

[00:32:47] **Brian Douglas:** cheap. So

[00:32:48] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:32:49] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:32:49] **Brian Douglas:** pay

[00:32:49] **Brian Douglas:** for

[00:32:49] **Brian Douglas:** Codex, I pay

[00:32:50] **Brian Douglas:** for, they can't

[00:32:50] **Brian Douglas:** stay that

[00:32:50] **Robbie Wagner:** way though.

[00:32:51] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

[00:32:52] **Robbie Wagner:** well

[00:32:52] **Robbie Wagner:** at

[00:32:52] **Robbie Wagner:** the

[00:32:53] **Brian Douglas:** Google

[00:32:53] **Brian Douglas:** Open AI

[00:32:55] **Brian Douglas:** Microsoft

[00:32:55] **Brian Douglas:** level,

[00:32:56] **Brian Douglas:** 20

[00:32:56] **Brian Douglas:** bucks a

[00:32:56] **Brian Douglas:** month is

[00:32:57] **Brian Douglas:** fine.

[00:32:57] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah. But for

[00:32:58] **Brian Douglas:** companies

[00:32:58] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:32:58] **Brian Douglas:** gotta

[00:32:58] **Brian Douglas:** make

[00:32:59] **Brian Douglas:** real

[00:32:59] **Brian Douglas:** money,

[00:32:59] **Brian Douglas:** probably

[00:32:59] **Brian Douglas:** [00:33:00] not

[00:33:00] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:33:00] **Brian Douglas:** Devon's

[00:33:01] **Brian Douglas:** like 500

[00:33:01] **Brian Douglas:** bucks a

[00:33:01] **Brian Douglas:** month.

[00:33:02] **Brian Douglas:** I've never used

[00:33:02] **Brian Douglas:** it,

[00:33:03] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:33:03] **Brian Douglas:** it's

[00:33:03] **Brian Douglas:** enough

[00:33:04] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:33:04] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:37:20] **Robbie Wagner:** I guess

[00:37:20] **Robbie Wagner:** the frustration is like when you're really deep,

[00:39:41] **Brian Douglas:** then

[00:39:41] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:39:41] **Brian Douglas:** quad

[00:39:41] **Brian Douglas:** model will

[00:39:41] **Brian Douglas:** be

[00:39:41] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:39:42] **Brian Douglas:** oh,

[00:39:42] **Brian Douglas:** I've

[00:39:42] **Brian Douglas:** actually rewritten the

[00:39:43] **Brian Douglas:** use quad. and I'm

[00:39:45] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:39:45] **Robbie Wagner:** no, no. no. no, no.

[00:39:46] **Brian Douglas:** Stop

[00:39:47] **Brian Douglas:** doing

[00:39:47] **Brian Douglas:** right now.

[00:39:47] **Robbie Wagner:** now. We

[00:39:48] **Brian Douglas:** use

[00:39:48] **Brian Douglas:** GPT

[00:39:49] **Brian Douglas:** for

[00:39:49] **Brian Douglas:** in-app browsing stuff.

[00:39:51] **Brian Douglas:** We used a quad

[00:39:51] **Brian Douglas:** model to

[00:39:52] **Brian Douglas:** write

[00:39:52] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:39:52] **Brian Douglas:** code

[00:39:53] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:39:53] **Brian Douglas:** it's

[00:39:53] **Brian Douglas:** just

[00:39:53] **Brian Douglas:** like it. Every

[00:39:54] **Brian Douglas:** now

[00:39:54] **Brian Douglas:** and I get a little overzealous and be like,

[00:39:56] **Brian Douglas:** oh,

[00:39:56] **Brian Douglas:** hey,

[00:39:56] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:39:56] **Brian Douglas:** wrote

[00:39:57] **Brian Douglas:** this,

[00:39:57] **Brian Douglas:** uh,

[00:39:57] **Brian Douglas:** plan

[00:39:57] **Brian Douglas:** up. But,

[00:39:58] **Brian Douglas:** instead

[00:39:58] **Brian Douglas:** of using GPTO four oh, like we're

[00:39:59] **Brian Douglas:** gonna [00:40:00] use

[00:40:00] **Brian Douglas:** quad sonet for

[00:40:00] **Brian Douglas:** this. Right.

[00:40:01] **Brian Douglas:** It's

[00:40:01] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:40:02] **Brian Douglas:** no.

[00:40:02] **Brian Douglas:** get outta

[00:40:03] **Brian Douglas:** here

[00:40:03] **Brian Douglas:** with that.

[00:40:05] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh,

[00:40:05] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:40:06] **Robbie Wagner:** love

[00:40:06] **Robbie Wagner:** it though.

[00:40:06] **Brian Douglas:** Like Quad's.

[00:40:08] **Brian Douglas:** literally a dev re ai.

[00:40:09] **Brian Douglas:** agent.

[00:40:10] **Brian Douglas:** It's

[00:40:10] **Brian Douglas:** constantly

[00:40:11] **Brian Douglas:** selling

[00:40:11] **Brian Douglas:** you into

[00:40:11] **Brian Douglas:** stuff you should be

[00:40:12] **Brian Douglas:** using.

[00:40:13] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:40:13] **Nick Taylor:** It's

[00:40:13] **Nick Taylor:** so

[00:40:14] **Nick Taylor:** funny too when like, like, 'cause I use it to, I
don't just say make a blog post for me. I bring, I pull in sources, stuff I've
been working on. I'll tweak it and claw and be like, this is ready to ship. And
then I start a

[00:40:25] **Nick Taylor:** new conversation, I paste it in, review this
critically,

[00:40:28] **Nick Taylor:** and

[00:40:28] **Nick Taylor:** then

[00:40:29] **Nick Taylor:** it's like,

[00:40:29] **Nick Taylor:** and it's like,

[00:40:31] **Brian Douglas:** man,

[00:40:32] **Brian Douglas:** fun.

[00:40:32] **Nick Taylor:** things again.

[00:40:33] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:40:34] **Brian Douglas:** But

[00:40:34] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:40:34] **Brian Douglas:** gives you

[00:40:34] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:40:34] **Brian Douglas:** confidence,

[00:40:35] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:40:35] **Brian Douglas:** uh,

[00:40:35] **Brian Douglas:** it's like

[00:40:36] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:40:36] **Brian Douglas:** quads,

[00:40:36] **Brian Douglas:** just

[00:40:36] **Brian Douglas:** a, it's

[00:40:43] **Brian Douglas:** you run outta tokens. Yeah.

[00:40:45] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:40:45] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. I guess

[00:40:47] **Robbie Wagner:** that's the ultimate

[00:40:48] **Robbie Wagner:** goal is to just string

[00:40:49] **Robbie Wagner:** you

[00:40:49] **Robbie Wagner:** along

[00:40:49] **Robbie Wagner:** until you

[00:40:49] **Robbie Wagner:** spend all your money.

[00:40:51] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:40:52] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:40:52] **Brian Douglas:** That was the, That was

[00:40:53] **Brian Douglas:** the,

[00:40:53] **Brian Douglas:** uh,

[00:40:53] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:40:53] **Brian Douglas:** case

[00:40:54] **Brian Douglas:** where

[00:40:54] **Brian Douglas:** like when folks are doing quad code, early days,
where

[00:40:56] **Brian Douglas:** you are like,

[00:40:57] **Brian Douglas:** oh,

[00:40:57] **Brian Douglas:** don't

[00:40:57] **Brian Douglas:** pay the

[00:40:57] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:40:57] **Brian Douglas:** hundred dollars or whatever it is, let's just use
[00:41:00] tokens and like

[00:41:00] **Brian Douglas:** quickly you're

[00:41:01] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:41:01] **Brian Douglas:** oh,

[00:41:02] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:41:02] **Brian Douglas:** just

[00:41:02] **Brian Douglas:** wrote

[00:41:02] **Brian Douglas:** a commit

[00:41:03] **Brian Douglas:** message

[00:41:03] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:41:03] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:41:03] **Brian Douglas:** paid $14. Like what

[00:41:05] **Robbie Wagner:** happened?

[00:41:05] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah,

[00:41:05] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:41:06] **Robbie Wagner:** I was

[00:41:06] **Robbie Wagner:** using, uh, KLE. I think that's what it's called,
right?

[00:41:09] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. And it's like that,

[00:41:10] **Robbie Wagner:** or it's like,

[00:41:10] **Robbie Wagner:** oh, each thing you're

[00:41:11] **Robbie Wagner:** doing is

[00:41:11] **Robbie Wagner:** like,

[00:41:12] **Robbie Wagner:** a

[00:41:12] **Robbie Wagner:** cent

[00:41:12] **Robbie Wagner:** or

[00:41:12] **Robbie Wagner:** whatever. But then, you know, $25 later you're
like, oh, okay, let's

[00:41:17] **Robbie Wagner:** stop

[00:41:17] **Robbie Wagner:** doing this.

[00:41:18] **Brian Douglas:** This

[00:41:18] **Brian Douglas:** is good.

[00:41:18] **Brian Douglas:** This

[00:41:18] **Brian Douglas:** is

[00:41:18] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:41:18] **Brian Douglas:** a buying the first

[00:41:20] **Brian Douglas:** round of

[00:41:20] **Brian Douglas:** drinks, like Hey, how many

[00:41:21] **Brian Douglas:** people

[00:41:21] **Brian Douglas:** are

[00:41:21] **Brian Douglas:** here? Wait, how

[00:41:24] **Brian Douglas:** do we get

[00:41:24] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:41:24] **Brian Douglas:** this

[00:41:25] **Brian Douglas:** number?

[00:41:25] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:41:26] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:41:27] **Nick Taylor:** Yeah, that's like, there's, uh, I think I was
mentioning you a few weeks ago, or, when I was in SF last time, there's this

[00:41:32] **Nick Taylor:** project called sniffly.dev, which works well with
Claude Code and it's like, I'm pretty new to Kubernetes still.

[00:41:38] **Nick Taylor:** And like my talk today, I was talking about
Kubernetes and I had to get like a cluster up and stuff. my head of engineering
is like, he has alerts on spend for, for philanthropic. And he's like, yeah,

[00:41:48] **Nick Taylor:** I

[00:41:49] **Nick Taylor:** can

[00:41:49] **Nick Taylor:** tell

[00:41:49] **Nick Taylor:** when Nick's like working on a demo because it's
like, it goes from like $4 a day to like 180 bucks or whatever.

[00:41:56] **Nick Taylor:** But it's, uh, but the funny thing is like, that
sounds super expensive

[00:41:59] **Nick Taylor:** [00:42:00] but at

[00:42:00] **Nick Taylor:** the same

[00:42:00] **Nick Taylor:** time,

[00:42:00] **Nick Taylor:** it's like

[00:42:02] **Nick Taylor:** I

[00:42:02] **Nick Taylor:** spent like maybe

[00:42:03] **Nick Taylor:** a day,

[00:42:03] **Nick Taylor:** day

[00:42:04] **Nick Taylor:** and

[00:42:04] **Nick Taylor:** a

[00:42:04] **Nick Taylor:** half,

[00:42:04] **Nick Taylor:** just kind of troubleshoot

[00:42:05] **Nick Taylor:** something and then.

[00:42:07] **Nick Taylor:** I

[00:42:07] **Nick Taylor:** didn't

[00:42:07] **Nick Taylor:** bug anybody.

[00:42:08] **Nick Taylor:** So like Somebody's

[00:42:09] **Nick Taylor:** salary,

[00:42:09] **Nick Taylor:** like 180 bucks

[00:42:10] **Nick Taylor:** is like a

[00:42:11] **Nick Taylor:** drop

[00:42:11] **Nick Taylor:** in the pond

[00:42:12] **Nick Taylor:** compared to like,

[00:42:13] **Brian Douglas:** oh, speak

[00:42:13] **Brian Douglas:** for

[00:42:13] **Brian Douglas:** yourself. Yeah.

[00:42:14] **Brian Douglas:** I'm just Kidding.

[00:42:16] **Brian Douglas:** we

[00:42:16] **Brian Douglas:** actually track

[00:42:16] **Brian Douglas:** how our

[00:42:16] **Brian Douglas:** engineers

[00:42:17] **Brian Douglas:** and how much they spend on models and tokens
'cause

[00:42:20] **Brian Douglas:** it actually

[00:42:20] **Brian Douglas:** helps influence how we plan

[00:42:22] **Brian Douglas:** our product

[00:42:22] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:42:23] **Brian Douglas:** how

[00:42:23] **Brian Douglas:** folks will use

[00:42:23] **Brian Douglas:** it.

[00:42:24] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:42:24] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:42:24] **Brian Douglas:** think I

[00:42:24] **Brian Douglas:** was like

[00:42:25] **Brian Douglas:** rewriting the

[00:42:25] **Brian Douglas:** docs

[00:42:26] **Brian Douglas:** I'll

[00:42:26] **Brian Douglas:** use

[00:42:26] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:42:26] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:42:26] **Brian Douglas:** quad mode actually

[00:42:27] **Brian Douglas:** using

[00:42:27] **Brian Douglas:** Opus

[00:42:28] **Brian Douglas:** because Opus is great

[00:42:29] **Brian Douglas:** for the

[00:42:29] **Brian Douglas:** context

[00:42:30] **Brian Douglas:** window

[00:42:30] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:42:30] **Brian Douglas:** like deep

[00:42:31] **Brian Douglas:** thinking. So if

[00:42:31] **Brian Douglas:** you're

[00:42:31] **Brian Douglas:** like, Hey,

[00:42:32] **Brian Douglas:** look

[00:42:32] **Brian Douglas:** at

[00:42:32] **Brian Douglas:** all these

[00:42:32] **Brian Douglas:** prs,

[00:42:33] **Brian Douglas:** let's

[00:42:33] **Brian Douglas:** scaffold

[00:42:34] **Brian Douglas:** out some

[00:42:34] **Brian Douglas:** docs.

[00:42:35] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:42:35] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:42:35] **Brian Douglas:** think

[00:42:35] **Brian Douglas:** I did like a

[00:42:36] **Brian Douglas:** Monday

[00:42:36] **Brian Douglas:** and it was like

[00:42:37] **Brian Douglas:** $400 for the day.

[00:42:38] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:42:38] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:42:38] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:42:39] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:42:39] **Brian Douglas:** oh

[00:42:39] **Brian Douglas:** man,

[00:42:39] **Brian Douglas:** amazing.

[00:42:40] **Brian Douglas:** Let's keep

[00:42:43] **Robbie Wagner:** VC

[00:42:43] **Robbie Wagner:** money.

[00:42:44] **Brian Douglas:** Um,

[00:42:44] **Brian Douglas:** but Yeah.

[00:42:45] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:42:46] **Brian Douglas:** see,

[00:42:46] **Brian Douglas:** like, I

[00:42:47] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:42:47] **Brian Douglas:** when I see

[00:42:47] **Brian Douglas:** those numbers

[00:42:48] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:42:48] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:42:49] **Brian Douglas:** when

[00:42:49] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:42:49] **Brian Douglas:** run

[00:42:49] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:42:49] **Brian Douglas:** PR and it tells me like, oh, you spent

[00:42:51] **Brian Douglas:** 13

[00:42:51] **Brian Douglas:** cents.

[00:42:51] **Brian Douglas:** It's like, Oh,

[00:42:52] **Brian Douglas:** okay,

[00:42:53] **Brian Douglas:** cool.

[00:42:53] **Brian Douglas:** That's

[00:42:53] **Brian Douglas:** 13 cents

[00:42:54] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:42:54] **Brian Douglas:** my

[00:42:54] **Brian Douglas:** time. I didn't

[00:42:55] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:42:57] **Brian Douglas:** types.

[00:42:58] **Nick Taylor:** Yeah. Yeah. Totally

[00:42:59] **Robbie Wagner:** [00:43:00] worth it

[00:43:00] **Robbie Wagner:** as long

[00:43:01] **Robbie Wagner:** as you're keeping an eye

[00:43:02] **Robbie Wagner:** on

[00:43:02] **Robbie Wagner:** it.

[00:43:02] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:43:02] **Robbie Wagner:** So

[00:43:04] **Brian Douglas:** is

[00:43:04] **Brian Douglas:** literally

[00:43:04] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:43:04] **Brian Douglas:** we're

[00:43:04] **Brian Douglas:** in the

[00:43:05] **Brian Douglas:** heyday

[00:43:05] **Brian Douglas:** where

[00:43:05] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:43:05] **Brian Douglas:** spent a

[00:43:06] **Brian Douglas:** ton of

[00:43:06] **Brian Douglas:** time

[00:43:06] **Brian Douglas:** not writing code,

[00:43:07] **Brian Douglas:** doing the

[00:43:08] **Brian Douglas:** whole dev rail thing

[00:43:08] **Brian Douglas:** where

[00:43:09] **Brian Douglas:** I'd

[00:43:09] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:43:09] **Brian Douglas:** ship a

[00:43:09] **Brian Douglas:** bunch of tech

[00:43:10] **Brian Douglas:** debt

[00:43:10] **Brian Douglas:** and like a bunch of side projects. I think I had
like one PR inside a GitHub my

[00:43:13] **Brian Douglas:** entire five

[00:43:14] **Brian Douglas:** years

[00:43:14] **Brian Douglas:** there.

[00:43:15] **Brian Douglas:** 'cause

[00:43:15] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:43:15] **Brian Douglas:** knew like

[00:43:15] **Brian Douglas:** my

[00:43:16] **Brian Douglas:** code,

[00:43:16] **Brian Douglas:** I'm

[00:43:16] **Brian Douglas:** not

[00:43:16] **Brian Douglas:** maintaining that.

[00:43:17] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:43:17] **Brian Douglas:** that was like,

[00:43:17] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:43:17] **Brian Douglas:** promise of like,

[00:43:18] **Brian Douglas:** if you're gonna

[00:43:19] **Brian Douglas:** open

[00:43:19] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:43:19] **Brian Douglas:** pr,

[00:43:19] **Brian Douglas:** we're

[00:43:19] **Brian Douglas:** gonna

[00:43:20] **Brian Douglas:** ask

[00:43:20] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:43:20] **Brian Douglas:** about it later.

[00:43:21] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:43:21] **Brian Douglas:** And it's like, ah, I don't want that.

[00:43:22] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:43:23] **Brian Douglas:** don't

[00:43:23] **Brian Douglas:** want

[00:43:23] **Brian Douglas:** that job.

[00:43:23] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:43:23] **Brian Douglas:** didn't sign up for

[00:43:24] **Brian Douglas:** that.

[00:43:25] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:43:25] **Brian Douglas:** nowadays

[00:43:25] **Brian Douglas:** I'm like, oh,

[00:43:26] **Brian Douglas:** spent

[00:43:26] **Brian Douglas:** all summer

[00:43:27] **Brian Douglas:** basically

[00:43:27] **Brian Douglas:** doing python

[00:43:28] **Brian Douglas:** and data

[00:43:28] **Brian Douglas:** science.

[00:43:29] **Brian Douglas:** 'cause I was super interested in like learning it,
but

[00:43:31] **Brian Douglas:** I'm not going back

[00:43:32] **Brian Douglas:** to school for

[00:43:32] **Brian Douglas:** that.

[00:43:32] **Brian Douglas:** Sure. I'm like, not gonna

[00:43:34] **Brian Douglas:** bug

[00:43:34] **Brian Douglas:** my

[00:43:34] **Brian Douglas:** friend

[00:43:35] **Brian Douglas:** to like, do it for me. so I was just like, cool.

[00:43:36] **Brian Douglas:** so I built

[00:43:37] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:43:37] **Brian Douglas:** thing

[00:43:37] **Brian Douglas:** that's like

[00:43:38] **Brian Douglas:** DLT

[00:43:38] **Brian Douglas:** hub,

[00:43:39] **Brian Douglas:** and duct db, which are just Python data science
tools. but

[00:43:42] **Brian Douglas:** I built a

[00:43:42] **Brian Douglas:** sandbox

[00:43:42] **Brian Douglas:** to basically

[00:43:43] **Brian Douglas:** work inside of

[00:43:44] **Brian Douglas:** GitHub repos and like just start asking questions.

[00:43:47] **Brian Douglas:** That's actually

[00:43:47] **Brian Douglas:** what John built for us in,

[00:43:48] **Brian Douglas:** um, the

[00:43:49] **Brian Douglas:** SQL

[00:43:49] **Brian Douglas:** Editor thing.

[00:43:50] **Brian Douglas:** that's how I

[00:43:51] **Brian Douglas:** do like feature development. It's like is getting
the SQL

[00:43:53] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:43:53] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:43:54] **Brian Douglas:** think

[00:43:54] **Brian Douglas:** about

[00:43:54] **Brian Douglas:** like what data I can

[00:43:55] **Brian Douglas:** show, like

[00:43:55] **Brian Douglas:** what

[00:43:55] **Brian Douglas:** charts I

[00:43:56] **Brian Douglas:** can put together based on the data I have at hand.

[00:43:58] **Brian Douglas:** so I

[00:43:58] **Brian Douglas:** just

[00:43:58] **Brian Douglas:** rebuilt

[00:43:58] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:43:59] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:43:59] **Brian Douglas:** I was just like, [00:44:00]

[00:44:00] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:44:00] **Brian Douglas:** know

[00:44:00] **Brian Douglas:** how to

[00:44:01] **Brian Douglas:** architect

[00:44:02] **Brian Douglas:** this thing.

[00:44:02] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:44:02] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:44:02] **Brian Douglas:** I just gotten

[00:44:03] **Brian Douglas:** the quad

[00:44:03] **Brian Douglas:** desktop,

[00:44:04] **Brian Douglas:** it spit

[00:44:04] **Brian Douglas:** out

[00:44:04] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:44:04] **Brian Douglas:** bunch of things.

[00:44:05] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:44:05] **Brian Douglas:** might've did it seven

[00:44:06] **Brian Douglas:** times,

[00:44:07] **Brian Douglas:** built

[00:44:07] **Brian Douglas:** out

[00:44:07] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:44:07] **Brian Douglas:** plan for

[00:44:08] **Brian Douglas:** this.

[00:44:08] **Brian Douglas:** And then I finally was happy

[00:44:09] **Brian Douglas:** with like

[00:44:09] **Brian Douglas:** where

[00:44:09] **Brian Douglas:** it got

[00:44:10] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:44:10] **Brian Douglas:** and how

[00:44:10] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:44:11] **Brian Douglas:** would

[00:44:11] **Brian Douglas:** maintain it.

[00:44:11] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:44:11] **Brian Douglas:** I've

[00:44:12] **Brian Douglas:** been

[00:44:12] **Brian Douglas:** like running this sting, for the past three
months. It's

[00:44:14] **Brian Douglas:** been running on a fly

[00:44:15] **Brian Douglas:** box

[00:44:16] **Brian Douglas:** in production. Yeah. Its that for

[00:44:18] **Brian Douglas:** contributor

[00:44:19] **Brian Douglas:** info,

[00:44:19] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah,

[00:44:19] **Brian Douglas:** contributor info is like

[00:44:20] **Brian Douglas:** literally, uh, we called it pizza time,

[00:44:22] **Brian Douglas:** back in the open source time. So, pizza time was

[00:44:24] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:44:24] **Brian Douglas:** our, our, data

[00:44:25] **Brian Douglas:** pipeline is like rebuilding the getup archive.

[00:44:27] **Brian Douglas:** I essentially rebuilt

[00:44:29] **Brian Douglas:** that,

[00:44:30] **Brian Douglas:** just

[00:44:30] **Brian Douglas:** through

[00:44:30] **Brian Douglas:** ideas

[00:44:31] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:44:31] **Brian Douglas:** chatting

[00:44:31] **Brian Douglas:** with, with ai. cause I

[00:44:32] **Brian Douglas:** wasn't

[00:44:33] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:44:33] **Brian Douglas:** person that built it,

[00:44:34] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:44:34] **Brian Douglas:** I knew

[00:44:34] **Brian Douglas:** like the

[00:44:35] **Brian Douglas:** concept.

[00:44:36] **Brian Douglas:** And I,

[00:44:36] **Brian Douglas:** I,

[00:44:36] **Brian Douglas:** I had

[00:44:37] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:44:37] **Brian Douglas:** concept of

[00:44:37] **Brian Douglas:** a plan

[00:44:38] **Brian Douglas:** and,

[00:44:38] **Brian Douglas:** uh,

[00:44:39] **Brian Douglas:** I took that plan and like implemented it, which
is,

[00:44:41] **Brian Douglas:** yeah,

[00:44:41] **Brian Douglas:** I feel like I'm

[00:44:42] **Brian Douglas:** in a, a bit of a renaissance when it comes to AI
and like

[00:44:44] **Brian Douglas:** getting

[00:44:45] **Brian Douglas:** back

[00:44:45] **Brian Douglas:** into

[00:44:45] **Brian Douglas:** my, uh,

[00:44:46] **Brian Douglas:** getting

[00:44:46] **Brian Douglas:** my groove

[00:44:47] **Brian Douglas:** back

[00:44:47] **Brian Douglas:** essentially.

[00:44:48] **Nick Taylor:** so, you drinking from the fire

[00:44:49] **Nick Taylor:** hose? the

[00:44:49] **Nick Taylor:** the events,

[00:44:50] **Brian Douglas:** Yes.

[00:44:52] **Brian Douglas:** Okay.

[00:44:52] **Brian Douglas:** Okay.

[00:44:52] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:44:52] **Brian Douglas:** Yeah.

[00:44:53] **Brian Douglas:** So the

[00:44:53] **Brian Douglas:** events,

[00:44:53] **Brian Douglas:** API

[00:44:53] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:44:54] **Brian Douglas:** GitHub,

[00:44:54] **Brian Douglas:** you go to api.com/events. You get

[00:44:57] **Brian Douglas:** at the

[00:44:57] **Brian Douglas:** time at Open

[00:44:58] **Brian Douglas:** Source, it was every seven minutes. You get
[00:45:00] like new events, they've switched into every hour.

[00:45:02] **Brian Douglas:** but you

[00:45:02] **Brian Douglas:** can just pull that

[00:45:03] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:45:03] **Brian Douglas:** get

[00:45:03] **Brian Douglas:** every

[00:45:04] **Brian Douglas:** event,

[00:45:04] **Brian Douglas:** every repo

[00:45:04] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:45:05] **Brian Douglas:** want.

[00:45:05] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:45:05] **Brian Douglas:** I don't

[00:45:05] **Brian Douglas:** get every

[00:45:06] **Brian Douglas:** single

[00:45:06] **Brian Douglas:** repo.

[00:45:07] **Brian Douglas:** Okay? Uh, I only

[00:45:08] **Brian Douglas:** get like 51 repos. So if you're in contributor

[00:45:10] **Brian Douglas:** info, you can opt in, say, Hey, I want this

[00:45:12] **Brian Douglas:** repo to

[00:45:13] **Brian Douglas:** be tracked. and

[00:45:14] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:45:14] **Brian Douglas:** right

[00:45:14] **Brian Douglas:** now

[00:45:15] **Brian Douglas:** it's 53 or 52,

[00:45:16] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:45:16] **Brian Douglas:** I'll just

[00:45:17] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:45:17] **Brian Douglas:** run

[00:45:17] **Brian Douglas:** it on a daily crawl.

[00:45:18] **Brian Douglas:** Like go catch it up.

[00:45:19] **Brian Douglas:** and I

[00:45:19] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:45:19] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:45:20] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:45:20] **Brian Douglas:** clever

[00:45:20] **Brian Douglas:** thing where you're like,

[00:45:21] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:45:21] **Brian Douglas:** this is like

[00:45:21] **Brian Douglas:** the problem

[00:45:22] **Brian Douglas:** of open source.

[00:45:22] **Brian Douglas:** It got

[00:45:22] **Brian Douglas:** very

[00:45:23] **Brian Douglas:** expensive '

[00:45:23] **Brian Douglas:** 'cause we had like

[00:45:24] **Brian Douglas:** 300,000 repos,

[00:45:25] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:45:26] **Brian Douglas:** people

[00:45:26] **Brian Douglas:** are

[00:45:26] **Brian Douglas:** looking

[00:45:27] **Brian Douglas:** up maybe

[00:45:27] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:45:27] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:45:27] **Brian Douglas:** hundred

[00:45:27] **Brian Douglas:** of. Uh, so

[00:45:28] **Brian Douglas:** instead

[00:45:29] **Brian Douglas:** I've

[00:45:29] **Brian Douglas:** inversed that

[00:45:30] **Brian Douglas:** where

[00:45:30] **Brian Douglas:** if

[00:45:30] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:45:30] **Brian Douglas:** ask

[00:45:31] **Brian Douglas:** for

[00:45:31] **Brian Douglas:** the repo,

[00:45:31] **Brian Douglas:** I will start tracking it.

[00:45:32] **Brian Douglas:** if,

[00:45:32] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:45:32] **Brian Douglas:** never

[00:45:33] **Brian Douglas:** view

[00:45:33] **Brian Douglas:** the repo,

[00:45:34] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:45:34] **Brian Douglas:** will delete it. Uh, so

[00:45:35] **Brian Douglas:** it's

[00:45:35] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:45:35] **Brian Douglas:** page view based

[00:45:37] **Brian Douglas:** date data fetching.

[00:45:38] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:45:38] **Brian Douglas:** like if you,

[00:45:38] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:45:38] **Brian Douglas:** you up

[00:45:39] **Robbie Wagner:** a

[00:45:39] **Robbie Wagner:** bot

[00:45:39] **Robbie Wagner:** to

[00:45:39] **Robbie Wagner:** keep

[00:45:39] **Robbie Wagner:** viewing it,

[00:45:40] **Robbie Wagner:** and then, uh, yeah. yeah.

[00:45:41] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:45:41] **Brian Douglas:** basically

[00:45:42] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:45:42] **Brian Douglas:** set

[00:45:42] **Brian Douglas:** up

[00:45:42] **Brian Douglas:** some

[00:45:42] **Brian Douglas:** ingest and some super base edge functions, that
type right.

[00:45:46] **Brian Douglas:** into my super

[00:45:46] **Brian Douglas:** base.

[00:45:47] **Brian Douglas:** and then

[00:45:47] **Brian Douglas:** basically if like you're,

[00:45:48] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:45:48] **Brian Douglas:** keep logs

[00:45:49] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:45:49] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:45:49] **Brian Douglas:** who's

[00:45:49] **Brian Douglas:** viewing

[00:45:50] **Brian Douglas:** what.

[00:45:50] **Brian Douglas:** and so like

[00:45:50] **Brian Douglas:** all

[00:45:51] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:45:51] **Brian Douglas:** repos

[00:45:51] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:45:51] **Brian Douglas:** care

[00:45:51] **Brian Douglas:** about, the

[00:45:52] **Brian Douglas:** four of em

[00:45:52] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:45:52] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:45:52] **Brian Douglas:** look

[00:45:52] **Brian Douglas:** at

[00:45:53] **Brian Douglas:** all

[00:45:53] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:45:53] **Brian Douglas:** time.

[00:45:53] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:45:53] **Brian Douglas:** just stays always fresh.

[00:45:55] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:45:55] **Brian Douglas:** then stuff

[00:45:55] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:45:56] **Brian Douglas:** Microsoft BS code, like no

[00:45:57] **Brian Douglas:** one's looking

[00:45:58] **Brian Douglas:** at

[00:45:58] **Brian Douglas:** that.

[00:45:58] **Brian Douglas:** Like,

[00:45:58] **Brian Douglas:** it was

[00:45:58] **Brian Douglas:** just

[00:45:59] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:45:59] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:45:59] **Brian Douglas:** thing

[00:45:59] **Brian Douglas:** I should [00:46:00] once

[00:46:00] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:46:00] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:46:00] **Brian Douglas:** deletes it.

[00:46:01] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:46:01] **Robbie Wagner:** Okay.

[00:46:02] **Robbie Wagner:** So

[00:46:03] **Robbie Wagner:** I want to regress back a second to you were
saying, uh, you were learning Python and doing some data science stuff,
whatever.

[00:46:09] **Robbie Wagner:** You as

[00:46:10] **Robbie Wagner:** a established engineer, had success with that. I
wonder what you think about

[00:46:15] **Robbie Wagner:** people that are new to programming want to get
into the industry. Is AI hamstringing them because like they

[00:46:21] **Robbie Wagner:** don't

[00:46:22] **Robbie Wagner:** actually

[00:46:22] **Robbie Wagner:** learn

[00:46:22] **Robbie Wagner:** it, right?

[00:46:23] **Robbie Wagner:** what do you think?

[00:46:24] **Brian Douglas:** Man,

[00:46:24] **Brian Douglas:** You

[00:46:24] **Brian Douglas:** say

[00:46:25] **Brian Douglas:** hamstring, but

[00:46:25] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:46:25] **Brian Douglas:** I've

[00:46:26] **Brian Douglas:** got

[00:46:26] **Brian Douglas:** this

[00:46:26] **Brian Douglas:** Achilles

[00:46:26] **Brian Douglas:** thing that's

[00:46:27] **Brian Douglas:** happening right now. '

[00:46:27] **Brian Douglas:** 'cause I

[00:46:27] **Brian Douglas:** play

[00:46:27] **Brian Douglas:** basketball

[00:46:28] **Brian Douglas:** twice a

[00:46:28] **Brian Douglas:** week.

[00:46:29] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:46:29] **Brian Douglas:** I've been

[00:46:29] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:46:29] **Brian Douglas:** doing

[00:46:29] **Brian Douglas:** these stretches

[00:46:30] **Brian Douglas:** to like,

[00:46:31] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:46:31] **Brian Douglas:** don't want

[00:46:31] **Brian Douglas:** my

[00:46:31] **Brian Douglas:** Achilles material,

[00:46:32] **Brian Douglas:** like adjacent Tatum.

[00:46:33] **Brian Douglas:** I'm

[00:46:34] **Brian Douglas:** not out

[00:46:34] **Brian Douglas:** for

[00:46:34] **Brian Douglas:** the se,

[00:46:34] **Brian Douglas:** I can't

[00:46:35] **Brian Douglas:** be

[00:46:35] **Brian Douglas:** out for

[00:46:35] **Brian Douglas:** the season.

[00:46:35] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:46:35] **Brian Douglas:** gotta travel. but

[00:46:36] **Brian Douglas:** yes,

[00:46:37] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:46:37] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:46:38] **Brian Douglas:** if you come outta

[00:46:38] **Brian Douglas:** college and you're like,

[00:46:39] **Brian Douglas:** man,

[00:46:39] **Brian Douglas:** how am I gonna get a job or if I'm a bootcamp
grad,

[00:46:41] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:46:42] **Brian Douglas:** God bless

[00:46:43] **Brian Douglas:** you.

[00:46:43] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:46:43] **Brian Douglas:** like my recommendation

[00:46:44] **Brian Douglas:** for

[00:46:44] **Brian Douglas:** a lot

[00:46:45] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:46:45] **Brian Douglas:** folks,

[00:46:45] **Brian Douglas:** I was

[00:46:45] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:46:45] **Brian Douglas:** Nigeria, I

[00:46:46] **Brian Douglas:** did a workshop,

[00:46:47] **Brian Douglas:** is like,

[00:46:47] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:46:47] **Brian Douglas:** gotta

[00:46:47] **Brian Douglas:** read

[00:46:47] **Brian Douglas:** a book.

[00:46:48] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:46:48] **Brian Douglas:** it's

[00:46:48] **Brian Douglas:** like the

[00:46:49] **Brian Douglas:** inverse

[00:46:49] **Brian Douglas:** of like,

[00:46:49] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:46:50] **Brian Douglas:** could

[00:46:50] **Brian Douglas:** learn

[00:46:50] **Brian Douglas:** how

[00:46:50] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:46:50] **Brian Douglas:** code

[00:46:50] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:46:50] **Brian Douglas:** 13

[00:46:51] **Brian Douglas:** weeks

[00:46:51] **Brian Douglas:** or whatever

[00:46:51] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:46:51] **Brian Douglas:** was, six weeks.

[00:46:52] **Brian Douglas:** now

[00:46:53] **Brian Douglas:** you actually

[00:46:53] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:46:53] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:46:53] **Brian Douglas:** dig

[00:46:54] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:46:54] **Brian Douglas:** to figure out

[00:46:54] **Brian Douglas:** like,

[00:46:55] **Brian Douglas:** why

[00:46:55] **Brian Douglas:** am I

[00:46:55] **Brian Douglas:** doing this? And

[00:46:56] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:46:56] **Brian Douglas:** when,

[00:46:58] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:46:58] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:46:58] **Brian Douglas:** before

[00:46:58] **Brian Douglas:** you could like

[00:46:58] **Brian Douglas:** spend

[00:46:59] **Brian Douglas:** all day, every [00:47:00] day

[00:47:00] **Brian Douglas:** reading books and learning about languages and
never implementing things.

[00:47:03] **Brian Douglas:** But

[00:47:03] **Brian Douglas:** the reason

[00:47:03] **Brian Douglas:** I would say read a book

[00:47:05] **Brian Douglas:** or

[00:47:05] **Brian Douglas:** catch up

[00:47:05] **Brian Douglas:** that

[00:47:06] **Brian Douglas:** type

[00:47:06] **Brian Douglas:** of stuff

[00:47:06] **Brian Douglas:** is

[00:47:06] **Brian Douglas:** because

[00:47:07] **Brian Douglas:** you

[00:47:07] **Brian Douglas:** don't know what you don't know.

[00:47:08] **Brian Douglas:** So

[00:47:08] **Brian Douglas:** if you're like

[00:47:08] **Brian Douglas:** prompting

[00:47:09] **Brian Douglas:** Build

[00:47:09] **Brian Douglas:** Me app

[00:47:10] **Brian Douglas:** to do like whatever.

[00:47:11] **Brian Douglas:** my

[00:47:11] **Brian Douglas:** recommendation is

[00:47:12] **Brian Douglas:** like, you don't

[00:47:12] **Brian Douglas:** know

[00:47:12] **Brian Douglas:** if

[00:47:13] **Brian Douglas:** that's

[00:47:13] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:47:13] **Brian Douglas:** wrong

[00:47:13] **Brian Douglas:** thing cause

[00:47:14] **Brian Douglas:** you don't

[00:47:14] **Brian Douglas:** have

[00:47:14] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:47:14] **Brian Douglas:** experience.

[00:47:15] **Brian Douglas:** And

[00:47:15] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:47:15] **Brian Douglas:** only

[00:47:15] **Brian Douglas:** way to get the experience

[00:47:16] **Brian Douglas:** is by either building

[00:47:17] **Brian Douglas:** or asking

[00:47:18] **Brian Douglas:** other

[00:47:18] **Brian Douglas:** folks

[00:47:18] **Brian Douglas:** that know it or

[00:47:19] **Brian Douglas:** just reading books.

[00:47:20] **Brian Douglas:** And a

[00:47:20] **Brian Douglas:** lot

[00:47:20] **Brian Douglas:** of

[00:47:20] **Brian Douglas:** folks don't

[00:47:21] **Brian Douglas:** ask,

[00:47:21] **Brian Douglas:** they

[00:47:21] **Brian Douglas:** won't reach out.

[00:47:22] **Brian Douglas:** Also,

[00:47:23] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:47:23] **Brian Douglas:** don't got time to

[00:47:23] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:47:24] **Brian Douglas:** set

[00:47:24] **Brian Douglas:** up

[00:47:24] **Brian Douglas:** on

[00:47:24] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:47:24] **Brian Douglas:** Zoom

[00:47:24] **Brian Douglas:** call

[00:47:24] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:47:25] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:47:25] **Brian Douglas:** mentor people.

[00:47:26] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:47:26] **Brian Douglas:** if

[00:47:26] **Brian Douglas:** you came ready with

[00:47:27] **Brian Douglas:** like, Hey,

[00:47:27] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:47:27] **Brian Douglas:** read

[00:47:27] **Brian Douglas:** a book

[00:51:02] **Brian Douglas:** couple weeks ago I, um,

[00:51:03] **Brian Douglas:** I, vibe coded

[00:51:04] **Brian Douglas:** a

[00:51:04] **Brian Douglas:** game

[00:51:05] **Brian Douglas:** with

[00:51:05] **Brian Douglas:** my kids.

[00:51:06] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:51:06] **Brian Douglas:** would

[00:51:06] **Brian Douglas:** never build,

[00:51:07] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:51:07] **Brian Douglas:** know

[00:51:07] **Brian Douglas:** what what goes

[00:51:08] **Brian Douglas:** in the

[00:51:08] **Brian Douglas:** writing

[00:51:08] **Brian Douglas:** games,

[00:51:09] **Brian Douglas:** like even

[00:51:10] **Brian Douglas:** in JavaScript,

[00:51:10] **Brian Douglas:** it's

[00:51:10] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:51:11] **Brian Douglas:** too

[00:51:11] **Brian Douglas:** much

[00:51:11] **Brian Douglas:** work,

[00:51:11] **Brian Douglas:** not for me. Yeah.

[00:51:13] **Brian Douglas:** but what's really cool, I vibe coated a

[00:51:14] **Brian Douglas:** game, a

[00:51:14] **Brian Douglas:** platformer, and

[00:51:16] **Brian Douglas:** then I,

[00:51:16] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:51:16] **Brian Douglas:** went and downloaded a bunch

[00:51:17] **Brian Douglas:** of sprites

[00:51:19] **Brian Douglas:** off

[00:51:19] **Brian Douglas:** like a

[00:51:19] **Brian Douglas:** Sprite

[00:51:19] **Brian Douglas:** kit

[00:51:19] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:51:19] **Brian Douglas:** I'm

[00:51:20] **Brian Douglas:** like, cool.

[00:51:20] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:51:20] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:51:20] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:51:20] **Brian Douglas:** actually testing

[00:51:21] **Brian Douglas:** Gemini

[00:51:21] **Brian Douglas:** for this.

[00:51:22] **Brian Douglas:** but it was like, it

[00:51:22] **Brian Douglas:** actually did

[00:51:23] **Brian Douglas:** a good

[00:51:23] **Brian Douglas:** job

[00:51:23] **Brian Douglas:** on

[00:51:23] **Brian Douglas:** this. Like Jim and I take

[00:51:25] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:51:25] **Brian Douglas:** Sprite

[00:51:25] **Brian Douglas:** kit,

[00:51:25] **Brian Douglas:** apply

[00:51:26] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:51:26] **Brian Douglas:** to

[00:51:26] **Brian Douglas:** my, my

[00:51:26] **Brian Douglas:** game

[00:51:27] **Brian Douglas:** engine

[00:51:27] **Brian Douglas:** and

[00:51:27] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:51:27] **Brian Douglas:** did a

[00:51:27] **Brian Douglas:** pretty

[00:51:28] **Brian Douglas:** good job.

[00:51:28] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:51:28] **Brian Douglas:** I

[00:51:28] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:51:28] **Brian Douglas:** actually super,

[00:51:29] **Brian Douglas:** super

[00:51:29] **Brian Douglas:** proud

[00:51:29] **Brian Douglas:** of that. I

[00:51:30] **Brian Douglas:** do

[00:51:30] **Brian Douglas:** want to

[00:51:30] **Brian Douglas:** actually sit down

[00:51:31] **Brian Douglas:** one weekend and make the game work.

[00:51:32] **Brian Douglas:** so

[00:51:32] **Brian Douglas:** we

[00:51:33] **Brian Douglas:** built

[00:51:33] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:51:33] **Brian Douglas:** one,

[00:51:33] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:51:33] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:51:34] **Brian Douglas:** like RPG platformer

[00:51:35] **Brian Douglas:** thing.

[00:51:35] **Brian Douglas:** sorry,

[00:51:36] **Brian Douglas:** that's the two different

[00:51:36] **Brian Douglas:** things.

[00:51:37] **Brian Douglas:** But

[00:51:37] **Brian Douglas:** basically it's

[00:51:37] **Brian Douglas:** like a platformer,

[00:51:38] **Brian Douglas:** but

[00:51:39] **Brian Douglas:** it

[00:51:39] **Brian Douglas:** was

[00:51:39] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:51:39] **Brian Douglas:** in

[00:51:39] **Brian Douglas:** the RPG

[00:51:40] **Brian Douglas:** style,

[00:51:40] **Brian Douglas:** we

[00:51:40] **Brian Douglas:** like

[00:51:40] **Brian Douglas:** sort of roam

[00:51:41] **Brian Douglas:** the

[00:51:41] **Brian Douglas:** room

[00:51:42] **Brian Douglas:** and like

[00:51:42] **Brian Douglas:** jump and

[00:51:43] **Brian Douglas:** collect wands. So

[00:51:44] **Brian Douglas:** super

[00:51:44] **Brian Douglas:** simple game.

[00:51:45] **Brian Douglas:** 'cause I knew,

[00:51:46] **Brian Douglas:** I
