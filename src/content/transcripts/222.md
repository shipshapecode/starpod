[00:00:00] **Intro:** Welcome to Syntax. Welcome to a brand new episode of the
Front End Happy Hour podcast. Welcome to this week's JS Party. Live from Ship
Shape Studios, this is Whiskey Web and Whatnot. With your hosts, Robbie the
Wagner, and me, Charles William Carpenter III. That's right Charles. We drink
whiskey and talk about web development.

[00:00:27] **Intro:** I mean, it's all in the name. It's not that deep. This is
Whiskey Web and Whatnot. Do not adjust your set.

[00:00:36] **Robbie Wagner:** Hey, what's

[00:00:37] **Hendrik:** up? Live at all Things

[00:00:38] **Robbie Wagner:** Open with, , the folks from Code Rabbit. How's it
going guys?

[00:00:41] **Erik:** Pretty good.

[00:00:41] **Hendrik:** good. Yeah. Thanks for having us.

[00:00:43] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for coming on.

[00:00:45] **Robbie Wagner:** So before I ask you much else, we're gonna start
with the Cabernet, 'cause that's what we do here.

[00:00:50] **Nick:** All right.

[00:00:51] **Robbie Wagner:** just

[00:00:51] **Robbie Wagner:** had Josh. Now we have Joel.

[00:00:53] **Nick:** Oh,

[00:00:54] **Nick:** It's a double.

[00:00:54] **Nick:** J kind of day.

[00:00:55] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:00:56] **Hendrik:** Oh yeah. It's a long, long pour.

[00:00:58] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah. All right.

[00:00:59] **Hendrik:** Pass it [00:01:00] down. Yep.

[00:01:00] **Nick:** Oh, thanks Joel. Nice to meet

[00:01:02] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:01:04] **Erik:** So it must be hard

[00:01:04] **Hendrik:** for you guys

[00:01:06] **Erik:** like at a conference. Whoa.

[00:01:07] **Hendrik:** That is

[00:01:08] **Erik:** It's a

[00:01:08] **Hendrik:** a generous job. Yeah. You're

[00:01:10] **Erik:** Uh, you're my favorite bartender now.

[00:01:13] **Robbie Wagner:** Well, I mean, I don't wanna take these with me,
so,

[00:01:15] **Erik:** Thats, that's

[00:01:16] **Hendrik:** we've been saying all day.

[00:01:17] **Erik:** day. That's,

[00:01:18] **Nick:** way to think about it. Yeah,

[00:01:19] **Erik:** yeah.

[00:01:19] **Robbie Wagner:** I don't have a fancy toast for you guys. Anyone
have a, a toast that they have

[00:01:22] **Robbie Wagner:** on

[00:01:23] **Erik:** do we do, do, we do, finger out, like pinky

[00:01:25] **Hendrik:** out with

[00:01:25] **Hendrik:** the, You,

[00:01:26] **Nick:** the Sure. Like, like Dr. Evil or something like. 100
billion

[00:01:33] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I don't know. Here's the open source, I
guess.

[00:01:35] **Nick:** source.

[00:01:37] **Robbie Wagner:** Joel tastes, uh, similar to Josh, I would say.
Yeah.

[00:01:40] **Nick:** yeah. I think they're related.

[00:01:43] **Hendrik:** So

[00:01:44] **Robbie Wagner:** you're from Code Rabbit. Give an elevator pitch.
What is it? What, why do I want it?

[00:01:48] **Hendrik:** want it

[00:01:49] **Erik:** speed up your code review. Make it easier to do code

[00:01:52] **Hendrik:** you.

[00:01:53] **Robbie Wagner:** Alright,

[00:01:53] **Robbie Wagner:** cool. We're done. We'll

[00:01:54] **Erik:** see

[00:01:54] **Erik:** Yeah.

[00:01:54] **Nick:** All right, thanks

[00:01:55] **Hendrik:** guys.

[00:01:55] **Nick:** tha and that's the pod. Thanks for coming out.

[00:01:59] **Robbie Wagner:** [00:02:00] more in depth, like, why choose choose
it over something else? Like what is it, what's your bread and butter? Like,
what's the secret sauce,

[00:02:06] **Erik:** I think the first thing I would say is try all the things,

[00:02:09] **Robbie Wagner:** Okay.

[00:02:10] **Erik:** figure, like we've got a lot of competitors, , they've got
a lot of tools, they've got

[00:02:13] **Erik:** a

[00:02:13] **Erik:** lot of products.

[00:02:15] **Erik:** Try

[00:02:15] **Erik:** em all.

[00:02:16] **Erik:** See the one that, that you like the most, the one that
gives you the most value. we're here to provide value support people. if it you
pick another one, my only request would be that you let us know why and what we
could do better. we have a, a default configuration that we think works really
well with a lot of people, , for really any language, any kind of repo.

[00:02:33] **Erik:** and it's highly configurable as well. So it's a, it's a
really quick onboarding like.

[00:02:38] **Erik:** Log in with

[00:02:39] **Erik:** , GitHub or any SSO priority. You want, authorize the Code
Rabbit ai , OAuth GitHub

[00:02:46] **Erik:** app. So that's your second click. And then it's set to auto
review any EPR. So as soon as you open up a pr, it's gonna fire off.

[00:02:54] **Erik:** You'll see, there'll be a comment that says, Hey, I see
this. I'm gonna be comparing, this commit and this commit, [00:03:00] and it's
gonna take. A little bit of time because we, we pull down, , all

[00:03:04] **Erik:** that code.

[00:03:05] **Erik:** , We run, I don't know, probably hundreds , of different
tools, workflows, to try to understand what's going on in the code.

[00:03:11] **Erik:** everything I, I, I think one of the coolest things is, uh,
we build up the abstract 10 tax tree,

[00:03:16] **Erik:** uh, so we can really know how everything's connected. , And
then one of the things that is just immediate value that you'll see, , by
default. Is a sequence diagram. So we'll give you an overview summary, that kind
of stuff, but we'll also provide you a visual sequence diagram of what's going
on in the code based

[00:03:31] **Erik:** on the logic.

[00:03:32] **Erik:** It's not, you know, we've got a series of prompts that
start with your, , the world's best code reviewer,

[00:03:38] **Erik:** uh,

[00:03:38] **Nick:** okay. Okay. Okay.

[00:03:39] **Hendrik:** and

[00:03:40] **Hendrik:** yoing

[00:03:40] **Hendrik:** it.

[00:03:40] **Erik:** so,

[00:03:41] **Erik:** It's just a ton of static tools. Like we're, we're really
open about it, , that you can go on our site if you're. You know, enterprise,
you probably care a lot about, ,

[00:03:48] **Erik:** compliance

[00:03:48] **Erik:** stuff, data retention policies, that kind of thing.

[00:03:52] **Erik:** , We're super open about

[00:03:52] **Erik:** all that

[00:03:53] **Erik:** stuff.

[00:03:53] **Erik:** Trust dot code rabbit.ai, if you want to wanna see that. We
also have a, a blog post where we try to be open about, you know, as [00:04:00]
soon as a new model comes out, , we recognize that we have a lot of really
valuable, information just from seeing so many different repos.

[00:04:08] **Erik:** Were, over 2 million repos,

[00:04:09] **Erik:** 13

[00:04:10] **Erik:** million.

[00:04:11] **Erik:** and growing.

[00:04:11] **Erik:** It's probably larger

[00:04:13] **Erik:** than that, , as I was last week. reviews that have been
done. so we have a lot of, you know, no one else really has that much
information about code review and be able to kind of evaluate new models right
as they come out.

[00:04:25] **Erik:** And

[00:04:25] **Erik:** so we, we try

[00:04:26] **Erik:** to , blog about that stuff. Like when Claude, , four five
Sonic came out, we got a blog post about that. We're,

[00:04:30] **Erik:** we're showing

[00:04:31] **Erik:** kind of, of running through all of our, our evaluations,
our data.

[00:04:34] **Erik:** What do we

[00:04:35] **Erik:** understand? Uh, that one's a really interesting 'cause it's
like, it's better, but there's a paradox involved in it and I won't give away
more.

[00:04:41] **Erik:** You gotta go read the post.

[00:04:42] **Erik:** but then, you know, g PT five came out and GP five codex
came out. These are all things in the last like month and a half, something like
that. and we compare those two

[00:04:49] **Erik:** and we show like,

[00:04:50] **Erik:** what do we

[00:04:50] **Erik:** find? , We don't try to hide that as like, you know,
competitive advantage information or anything like that.

[00:04:55] **Erik:** We want to, we just wanna be there to support people. Like,
I think I said the other day and, and. A couple people have been saying
[00:05:00] at, at this conference especially, and this will be the last thing I
say,

[00:05:03] **Erik:** on this

[00:05:03] **Erik:** breath,

[00:05:04] **Hendrik:** uh,

[00:05:05] **Hendrik:** is that the,

[00:05:06] **Erik:** the

[00:05:06] **Erik:** most

[00:05:07] **Erik:** selfish thing that you can do in your life is

[00:05:09] **Erik:** be generous to others.

[00:05:11] **Erik:** Good things

[00:05:12] **Erik:** happen

[00:05:12] **Erik:** if good things happen to you, if you're just generous for
others, not like, oh, I'm gonna be generous, cause the ROI is high on being
generous, but like, just being generous. people talk to you maybe down the line,
like someone connects

[00:05:25] **Erik:** you, maybe

[00:05:26] **Erik:** they

[00:05:26] **Robbie Wagner:** don't.

[00:05:27] **Erik:** But you still feel good for helping somebody.

[00:05:28] **Erik:** So,

[00:05:29] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:05:30] **Robbie Wagner:** that's a good point.

[00:05:31] **Robbie Wagner:** So

[00:05:31] **Robbie Wagner:** you talked a bit about, . I forget the numbers.
Some millions of like, reviews, whatever. so I'm curious about policies on what
if I don't want it to learn from my stuff or like I have a on-prem need to be
like very secure or like, can you do that kind of thing or.

[00:05:49] **Erik:** Yep. it's

[00:05:50] **Erik:** kind of like,

[00:05:51] **Erik:** I dunno, I think a lot of people think there's, some
mythical secret sauce that you're going to, you're gonna be able to develop if
you like, retain everybody's, vacuum it all up,

[00:05:59] **Erik:** [00:06:00] get everyone's data

[00:06:01] **Erik:** and store it, and then you're gonna, you know, have some
kind of wild insights into how the world works or something that no one else
does.

[00:06:08] **Erik:** But I think in reality, like if you do that, the first
thing you gotta do now is, okay, now we gotta have a, hire for a security team.

[00:06:15] **Erik:** Now we gotta, , deal with the inevitable risk of like, You
know, some kind of leak of, sensitive information. Okay. Now, now we definitely
gotta have a PR team or, or get the best PR people and, and you get, you know,
systems and, data warehousing.

[00:06:29] **Erik:** Those are just gonna be costs that just keep scaling up.
you know, and then you're gonna have to hire like the world's best data
scientists and ML engineers to just kind of dig into that data. So, if you're a
startup trying to go fast, I think the most important thing is you just. You
find what you want to do and you do that one thing really, really well.

[00:06:47] **Erik:** And I see that a lot in, , a lot of open source projects
that are, are going that way. Like, like

[00:06:51] **Erik:** Ghostie,

[00:06:52] **Erik:** I was the I term user for a really long time and then, uh,
ghostie came out

[00:06:57] **Erik:** maybe

[00:06:57] **Erik:** to get like

[00:06:58] **Erik:** kind of direct at, at that [00:07:00] question,

[00:07:00] **Erik:** in order to do good code review, you need to know what's
actually

[00:07:03] **Erik:** in

[00:07:03] **Erik:** the code,

[00:07:04] **Erik:** which is kind of an obvious statement. But we see a lot of
people take

[00:07:08] **Erik:** a lot of shortcuts.

[00:07:09] **Erik:** So there're maybe indexing on things, or, or creating a
cash, embeddings, all that kind of stuff.

[00:07:16] **Erik:** And, and that can definitely help from like. you've got a
LLM and you're, you send a prompt. If you're giving it an ability to kind of
explore a, highly compressed space, like a, a vector embedding, of

[00:07:29] **Erik:** the

[00:07:29] **Erik:** code base,

[00:07:30] **Erik:** yeah, that's gonna help them. But what's gonna help them
more is the same. If you had a, human that had infinite kind of time and
resources and patience, to go through

[00:07:40] **Erik:** line

[00:07:41] **Erik:** by

[00:07:41] **Erik:** line, everything

[00:07:42] **Erik:** that's gonna

[00:07:42] **Erik:** be better than.

[00:07:43] **Erik:** kind of this.

[00:07:44] **Erik:** Intuition

[00:07:45] **Erik:** that

[00:07:45] **Erik:** it might have of what's going on in the code base from like
doing like some vector search kind of stuff. So, plus you gotta keep all that
stuff updated. I, I don't know how much you want to go into

[00:07:53] **Hendrik:** like

[00:07:53] **Hendrik:** all the

[00:07:54] **Hendrik:** things, but like, um,

[00:07:55] **Hendrik:** yeah.

[00:07:56] **Hendrik:** yeah. You

[00:07:57] **Hendrik:** tell me. So,

[00:07:58] **Robbie Wagner:** so

[00:07:58] **Robbie Wagner:** what you're saying is you, you [00:08:00] have a
human that, infinitely

[00:08:01] **Robbie Wagner:** knows every line of every code base is what I

[00:08:03] **Hendrik:** heard.

[00:08:03] **Erik:** yeah. It's a, it's an, it's an, we

[00:08:05] **Erik:** have one

[00:08:05] **Hendrik:** Term. Yeah.

[00:08:07] **Nick:** His, name's Jerry. That's Jerry.

[00:08:09] **Hendrik:** He does it all.

[00:08:10] **Erik:** Yeah.

[00:08:11] **Nick:** Kudos to you, man.

[00:08:12] **Erik:** Yeah. Dude. Jerry. Hey. That's another,

[00:08:14] **Nick:** That's

[00:08:14] **Nick:** another,

[00:08:14] **Nick:** that's another J.

[00:08:15] **Nick:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:08:16] **Hendrik:** we

[00:08:16] **Hendrik:** go.

[00:08:16] **Hendrik:** It's gonna be the next one on the list. Yeah. Yeah. No,
but I think want to just touch on one thing that you said. I think one thing
that I noticed about how we do things that Code Rabbit, that is different to how
I see many of the competitors going out there, and especially.

[00:08:29] **Hendrik:** Going to this conference, you know, you talk a lot about
the competitors. Of course, everybody's using getup, co-pilot, everybody's been
checking out Buck Bot from Cursor. And, I think there is no team out there in
the world right now that has been specialized on code reviews as intensively, as
code Revit.

[00:08:46] **Hendrik:** And that really shows, , from everything, starting from
the user experience when you onboard someone to the product. All the way through
how you configure our YAML file, the configurations that you can set, the ease
of use, like literally just coming here, I was [00:09:00] almost late, almost
would've broken on my German promise of being online because I was onboarding a
very experienced JavaScript developer who hasn't even figured out that there was
a YAML file.

[00:09:09] **Hendrik:** 'cause he was so satisfied with the product out of

[00:09:11] **Robbie Wagner:** the

[00:09:12] **Robbie Wagner:** box.

[00:09:12] **Nick:** Okay.

[00:09:13] **Hendrik:** So, yeah.

[00:09:14] **Erik:** yeah.

[00:09:14] **Erik:** that's a struggle for

[00:09:15] **Hendrik:** us right now

[00:09:16] **Erik:** is like we see a lot of people and, and one of the great
things about just being so,

[00:09:20] **Erik:** oh, , we should say some really cool facts for open source
about Code Revit.

[00:09:24] **Erik:** It's free for open source

[00:09:26] **Erik:** by

[00:09:26] **Erik:** default.

[00:09:27] **Erik:** There's no . Application you need to fill out and someone
will review it or not review it. if the repo's

[00:09:32] **Erik:** set to public,

[00:09:33] **Erik:** I've got think 160, repos on my GitHub, just random stuff,
like 99% of it. but code rabbit's on them all for free

[00:09:42] **Erik:** forever.

[00:09:43] **Erik:** so we just

[00:09:43] **Erik:** eat that.

[00:09:44] **Erik:** It's a very large inference

[00:09:45] **Erik:** cost.

[00:09:46] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah,

[00:09:46] **Hendrik:** I was gonna say

[00:09:47] **Robbie Wagner:** could be abused.

[00:09:48] **Erik:** Yeah.

[00:09:49] **Erik:** Um,

[00:09:49] **Erik:** and we see especially on like, really big open source
projects,

[00:09:53] **Erik:** people

[00:09:55] **Erik:** it's kind of like 50 50 where people have discovered
[00:10:00] that there's configuration that you can do

[00:10:02] **Erik:** outside of like the default configuration. And then they
kind of, some are like, they change one thing and some are like, they make it do
whatever they want.

[00:10:11] **Erik:** I've seen is great in open source because you can just see
how people are using your product too.

[00:10:15] **Erik:** more people, not our competitors, maybe should do more for
open source? No,

[00:10:19] **Erik:** them, them too. Them too. Them too.

[00:10:20] **Hendrik:** Uh,

[00:10:21] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah.

[00:10:21] **Robbie Wagner:** GitHub don't do anything for open

[00:10:22] **Hendrik:** source.

[00:10:25] **Erik:** but we can see, like, I saw one, , last week where they had
it set up so that, you know, someone would open

[00:10:31] **Erik:** a PR

[00:10:32] **Erik:** code.

[00:10:32] **Erik:** Rabbit would do its review. When Codera was

[00:10:34] **Erik:** done, it had a template for how. PR should be done. And in
that template is, not just, you know, the, the naming and whatnot, but also,
what code rabbit's, summaries and walkthroughs should be because I guess I
should probably reach out to them.

[00:10:47] **Erik:** they

[00:10:48] **Erik:** thought, okay, well we don't want that to be the second
comment.

[00:10:50] **Erik:** We want the sequence diagram. We want the summary

[00:10:53] **Erik:** in

[00:10:53] **Erik:** the first

[00:10:54] **Erik:** comment.

[00:10:55] **Erik:** And so they had it, so the pipeline, it

[00:10:57] **Erik:** would run,

[00:10:57] **Erik:** and then

[00:10:58] **Erik:** the code Rabbit would [00:11:00] edit the first, the
authors, First comment on a pr, and I thought that was really cool, and I didn't
even, hadn't even thought about doing that myself.

[00:11:07] **Erik:** so we have kind of like this challenge of like
communicating

[00:11:09] **Erik:** to people like, hey,

[00:11:10] **Erik:** first time using it, maybe it's like, you know, 50 50, hit
rate on the value that it gives you, like in the

[00:11:16] **Erik:** comments

[00:11:16] **Erik:** it gives.

[00:11:17] **Erik:** I'd argued that's a really good hit

[00:11:19] **Erik:** rate, , on signal to noise because that means that it's, it
is helping you, it's providing value.

[00:11:24] **Erik:** and especially on the first pass.

[00:11:26] **Erik:** you know, you open a PR and you have something, no one's
gonna come in. Hopefully you don't have a review process that's like in three
minutes. Looks good to me, merge to production.

[00:11:34] **Erik:** and you know,

[00:11:35] **Erik:** it

[00:11:35] **Robbie Wagner:** that?

[00:11:37] **Erik:** never,

[00:11:40] **Robbie Wagner:** Uh,

[00:11:40] **Erik:** you come back 15, 20 minutes later or you know, the next
day or whatever and you get this kind of helpful stuff there.

[00:11:45] **Erik:** I think that's

[00:11:46] **Erik:** really great.

[00:11:46] **Erik:** But then you can just take it further. It's like, well, it,
it does a really good job. You know, and we're doing these other things still in
review, and it's like anything that you're doing, that you're always doing or
always expecting in code review, you can probably get Code Rabbit to do

[00:11:58] **Erik:** it.

[00:11:58] **Erik:** you can just [00:12:00] ask, so you can ask. This is
another great fun feature. I, I've got a great story from yesterday about this
feature. , But you can just tag as long as code rabbit's on your, your repo, you
can just tag at Code Rabbit ai. And ask

[00:12:13] **Erik:** it

[00:12:14] **Erik:** anything.

[00:12:14] **Erik:** and I mean anything

[00:12:15] **Erik:** like,

[00:12:17] **Erik:** I

[00:12:17] **Erik:** wish I, I had this

[00:12:18] **Erik:** pulled

[00:12:18] **Erik:** up,

[00:12:18] **Robbie Wagner:** Gimme the

[00:12:19] **Robbie Wagner:** Gettysburg

[00:12:19] **Hendrik:** address,

[00:12:20] **Hendrik:** so

[00:12:20] **Nick:** yeah. yes,

[00:12:21] **Nick:** you

[00:12:21] **Nick:** can,

[00:12:22] **Nick:** Should I put ham on

[00:12:23] **Erik:** right? Yes. we

[00:12:26] **Hendrik:** can

[00:12:26] **Hendrik:** ask

[00:12:27] **Hendrik:** all

[00:12:27] **Hendrik:** those

[00:12:27] **Erik:** things

[00:12:27] **Erik:** after. If you wanna pull it up right

[00:12:29] **Erik:** now, we can

[00:12:29] **Erik:** do it.

[00:12:29] **Erik:** had a gentleman and he had his, uh,

[00:12:32] **Erik:** uh,

[00:12:32] **Erik:** daughter

[00:12:32] **Erik:** with him eight years old. And, It's hard to stay in one
place if you've

[00:12:37] **Erik:** got

[00:12:37] **Erik:** a

[00:12:37] **Erik:** little

[00:12:38] **Erik:** kid.

[00:12:38] **Erik:** And he had a lot of questions and wanted to see like all,
all tons of things.

[00:12:42] **Erik:** cause he was doing a talk on, code review

[00:12:44] **Nick:** Okay. and,

[00:12:45] **Nick:** uh, oh, Avi

[00:12:46] **Nick:** yeah,

[00:12:46] **Nick:** yeah. yeah. I know Avi.

[00:12:47] **Erik:** Yeah. Yeah.

[00:12:48] **Erik:** Yeah.

[00:12:48] **Erik:** I think it's like a, it's like a

[00:12:50] **Erik:** power

[00:12:50] **Erik:** couple

[00:12:50] **Erik:** and they're like, yeah. Trading off, taking care of the
kids. Like, and I, I know what that's like. and you

[00:12:56] **Erik:** kind of get

[00:12:57] **Erik:** like.

[00:12:57] **Erik:** Anxious 'cause you're getting pulled away by one [00:13:00]
thing and you got something else as well.

[00:13:02] **Erik:** And so when she heard that about the, the chat thing, she's
like, oh, okay.

[00:13:06] **Erik:** we asked like a bunch of, of, of fun questions. like,
what's the most popular

[00:13:10] **Erik:** country

[00:13:10] **Erik:** in the world?

[00:13:11] **Robbie Wagner:** popular?

[00:13:12] **Robbie Wagner:** how?

[00:13:13] **Erik:** That's a great

[00:13:15] **Nick:** question. '

[00:13:15] **Erik:** cause I, I asked her, I was like, popular. She said
popular. I'm like, Hmm,

[00:13:18] **Erik:** that's ambiguous.

[00:13:19] **Erik:** Uh, And

[00:13:20] **Erik:** so what it did was, uh, what Cobra did, and you can see it
because again, we're like, if you do chat with Code Rabbit, you get every single
time at the top of its response, you'll get, the analysis chain. And it's,
hidden. And I just realized today that, I made the connection that it's

[00:13:34] **Erik:** a

[00:13:34] **Erik:** carrot,

[00:13:35] **Nick:** you know, it's

[00:13:35] **Nick:** like

[00:13:36] **Nick:** oh, rabbit.

[00:13:37] **Hendrik:** Triangled carrot,

[00:13:37] **Erik:** Well,

[00:13:38] **Erik:** I mean

[00:13:38] **Erik:** like the, just in like GitHub markdown,

[00:13:40] **Nick:** how

[00:13:40] **Nick:** you

[00:13:40] **Nick:** can

[00:13:41] **Nick:** collapse. Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah. Their, their detailed
summary, uh, expandable HT

[00:13:47] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, Carrot

[00:13:48] **Hendrik:** with

[00:13:48] **Hendrik:** a knee.

[00:13:49] **Hendrik:** Yeah.

[00:13:49] **Hendrik:** So

[00:13:50] **Hendrik:** like

[00:13:50] **Erik:** the,

[00:13:50] **Erik:** the,

[00:13:51] **Erik:** my dad joke, impulse is like, there's something there. We
gotta do something with the carrot. but in that you can see exactly what code
rabbit's done to arrive at [00:14:00] whatever its response is.

[00:14:01] **Erik:** The answer is it's given. So

[00:14:02] **Erik:** on

[00:14:02] **Hendrik:** popular

[00:14:04] **Erik:** you can see it, it performed

[00:14:05] **Erik:** a web

[00:14:05] **Erik:** query and then it was like, it is like, what's the most
popular country? And then it came

[00:14:10] **Erik:** up

[00:14:10] **Erik:** with,

[00:14:10] **Erik:** as

[00:14:10] **Erik:** part

[00:14:11] **Erik:** of

[00:14:11] **Erik:** that web

[00:14:11] **Erik:** query.

[00:14:12] **Erik:** What's the one that, , is like viewed as the best

[00:14:15] **Erik:** to

[00:14:15] **Erik:** go to?

[00:14:16] **Erik:** So like, popular and so it, it has a citation for some
travel thing or whatever, some travel

[00:14:22] **Erik:** magazine.

[00:14:23] **Erik:** then it was like, which one has

[00:14:24] **Hendrik:** the most

[00:14:24] **Hendrik:** people

[00:14:26] **Erik:** and which one has, , the most tourist to visit it each
year. And then so it provided that in like a kind of a fun thing and then asked
the second one was, can you go to the

[00:14:35] **Erik:** bathroom?

[00:14:36] **Erik:** and it responded

[00:14:38] **Erik:** with,

[00:14:38] **Hendrik:** which

[00:14:38] **Hendrik:** is,

[00:14:38] **Hendrik:** fund your

[00:14:39] **Hendrik:** kids.

[00:14:39] **Hendrik:** yeah.

[00:14:40] **Hendrik:** These are,

[00:14:40] **Erik:** these

[00:14:40] **Robbie Wagner:** are

[00:14:40] **Hendrik:** topics that

[00:14:41] **Hendrik:** are

[00:14:42] **Erik:** our youth are talking about.

[00:14:43] **Erik:** I'd

[00:14:43] **Erik:** like

[00:14:43] **Erik:** to say the wine has kicked in that I, it has

[00:14:45] **Hendrik:** has not

[00:14:45] **Erik:** kicked in yet.

[00:14:47] **Nick:** Oh, Joel. Oh,

[00:14:48] **Nick:** Joel. And,

[00:14:49] **Erik:** And it, It came out with like a really cute message. It was
like, no, I can't, 'cause I'm a robot. I can help you with. these things and
these things. Put a little bunny emoji in there and then it said, like,

[00:14:57] **Erik:** the second

[00:14:58] **Erik:** line was like,

[00:14:58] **Erik:** but would you like to [00:15:00] talk about the code that's
in PR number 18?

[00:15:05] **Nick:** I know code rabbit's used in re like, 'cause I know Daniel
Rowe from like the n team and I know I contributed to one of his projects and he
has Code Rabbit running there. is Code Rabbit just for code review or is it
like, can you use it like a cloud code or like a Codex or is it really, is, is
the company really focused just on code review?

[00:15:26] **Hendrik:** Yeah.

[00:15:27] **Hendrik:** Yeah,

[00:15:28] **Nick:** Okay. No, no, it's not a bad thing. I'm just generally just
generally curious. 'cause like a lot of people try to be like, we're the

[00:15:34] **Erik:** everything

[00:15:34] **Erik:** kind of Yes. We see that. We see that a lot.

[00:15:37] **Erik:** so, uh, yeah, a couple things that make us kind of
different in that, area

[00:15:40] **Erik:** is,

[00:15:40] **Erik:** a lot of people are out there saying like, you know, our AI
coding tool, or AI code review tool or something like that is so good that, you
can just let it go YOLO mode and just go. and I think we all have seen the
results of those kinds of things when you just, you just let them go.

[00:15:57] **Erik:** , They are definitely getting better and better and better
and better, [00:16:00] almost every month now.

[00:16:01] **Erik:** but,

[00:16:01] **Erik:** we don't try

[00:16:02] **Erik:** to make

[00:16:02] **Erik:** those claims. we think the responsible thing to do is to be
an owner of your work, of your craft and, do that, human review, it's most

[00:16:11] **Erik:** powerful

[00:16:12] **Erik:** when it's augmenting , your flows.

[00:16:14] **Erik:** So we try to meet people where they

[00:16:16] **Erik:** are. So the other thing that makes us different there is we
do have an IDE extension, works in vs. Code cursor, windsurf, et cetera. That
helps you. And when you, you know, the default is when you make a commit, a
little thing pops up for a few seconds that says, I noticed you, you made a
commit.

[00:16:29] **Erik:** You want me to review this for you here

[00:16:31] **Erik:** because you're there.

[00:16:32] **Erik:** , Same with, you know, when you open up a pr, , it's there.
That's where you are as a developer. We also have a CLI that we've, , we've put
out. It's, to my knowledge, still the only code review CLI. it's firing off a
code review.

[00:16:47] **Erik:** You know, you can compare whatever, commits you want.

[00:16:49] **Erik:** but what it's cool is if you're someone who's trying to, do
the forefront stuff, and try to, you know, put clawed in a container and just
let it, let it rip. you can have there, you know, [00:17:00] when you, you tell
Claude to, you know, build my, you know, trillion dollar, , SaaS company.

[00:17:05] **Erik:** , And you, you know, your one magic prompt like that, you
can say like, when you're done, run code rabbit, dash dash prompt only, or dash
dash plane. And what it'll do is, instead of that, it being like an interactive,
very

[00:17:17] **Erik:** pretty

[00:17:18] **Erik:** CLI, it's a really cool, gradient, , asky art thing. Okay.
I'm not, I'm, I won't go into that.

[00:17:23] **Erik:** Uh,

[00:17:24] **Erik:** I'm seeing the, I'm

[00:17:25] **Nick:** feeling

[00:17:25] **Nick:** it.

[00:17:25] **Nick:** The

[00:17:25] **Nick:** eye

[00:17:25] **Nick:** roll over

[00:17:26] **Nick:** here? no, no. no. I wasn't eye rolling. That's, uh,
something in my, I think it's just been a long day for me to, gave a talk
earlier and been working the booth. So, uh, no, definitely 100% know

[00:17:37] **Hendrik:** Need a little

[00:17:38] **Nick:** roll here.

[00:17:39] **Hendrik:** Maybe? Yeah,

[00:17:39] **Hendrik:** you did. Yeah, me up.

[00:17:41] **Erik:** but yeah, so like you can say like, when you're done, run
this and then wait and if you

[00:17:46] **Erik:** get

[00:17:46] **Erik:** issues back

[00:17:47] **Erik:** about your

[00:17:47] **Erik:** code, address those.

[00:17:49] **Erik:** And so what

[00:17:49] **Erik:** in that mode for code Revit, CLI, it won't give you like.

[00:17:54] **Erik:** All

[00:17:54] **Erik:** the things, it'll just give you what we give every single
time GitHub. we'll give you a [00:18:00] little thing also in a carrot, that
says prompt

[00:18:02] **Erik:** for

[00:18:02] **Erik:** AI

[00:18:02] **Erik:** agents. And

[00:18:04] **Erik:** so we just, you get a message, it's like one line or
something like that.

[00:18:08] **Erik:** It's like, here's the problem, here's a little a why.
couple sentences, and then here's what you need to do. and then that way, you
know, we're respecting, people that are using. Agents and it's, you know, single
model. So you don't wanna flood their context window with, with unnecessary
tokens.

[00:18:23] **Erik:** It's just what we think

[00:18:24] **Erik:** is the

[00:18:24] **Erik:** most efficient, kind of

[00:18:25] **Erik:** message

[00:18:26] **Erik:** to

[00:18:26] **Hendrik:** get to to ai.

[00:18:27] **Erik:** ai. So,

[00:18:27] **Erik:** I've definitely thrown that in, containers. I have a, a pet
project where I'm doing game development. That's only my rule is I can't look at
the code.

[00:18:35] **Nick:** Okay.

[00:18:36] **Nick:** Uh,

[00:18:36] **Hendrik:** and

[00:18:37] **Hendrik:** we, nothing

[00:18:37] **Hendrik:** can

[00:18:37] **Hendrik:** go

[00:18:38] **Nick:** just make

[00:18:38] **Erik:** something

[00:18:39] **Erik:** Yeah, exactly. And then, so I have, every single one.

[00:18:42] **Erik:** And you can do this with cursor codex, Gemini, anything.
'cause it, at the end of the day, you're just asking it to run a shell shell
command. So if you have shell access to your, coding agent, you can run it. and
uh, It's fun to watch. it catches things.

[00:18:55] **Hendrik:** And

[00:18:55] **Hendrik:** again,

[00:18:55] **Hendrik:** like,

[00:18:56] **Erik:** I do look at those messages at least and, you know, not a
hundred percent hit rate.

[00:18:59] **Erik:** [00:19:00] Yeah.

[00:19:00] **Erik:** There's still definitely that need for human in loop there
and, and

[00:19:03] **Hendrik:** ownership. It's so funny you would mention that I was at
Frontier Tower, which is like this big community space in San Francisco. The
other weekend I met like this AI researcher from Stanford and he got a hundred
thousand dollars in like open AI credits, whatever. And he was telling me, yeah,
he's running like 120 Docker containers right now doing exactly that.

[00:19:20] **Nick:** It's like burn 'em

[00:19:21] **Hendrik:** Exactly. And the most success he had at the moment was
like trying to, , give it the overall mission to act as an army general. And
built you up in that way. But I actually wanted to pick up on something else. ,
Almost lost my plot. Yes. So I, I think you to back to your question about like,
do we only focus on code review?

[00:19:39] **Hendrik:** , Yes. And I think the main focus really is, , to focus
on senior developers and help them in their code review workflow, reduce the
cognitive load that you normally have when you are reviewing a large PR of a
junior dev or somebody else in your team. That, might not be as familiar with
with their code base, whatever they're pushing.

[00:19:57] **Hendrik:** So the, at the same time, you're looking at a new PR and
you've got so much new [00:20:00] code to figure out what it's actually doing,
just taking away 50% of that cognitive load. , By giving you a point to start
with, , giving you the sequence diagram to understand, okay, what is this person
actually trying to do?

[00:20:10] **Hendrik:** And just making, , sure that you have a, a coat with
your buddy on your site that you know, picks up some of the slack that you would
normally forget. that's been proven very powerful.

[00:20:19] **Nick:** Okay. No, that's great. I, I just heard a big

[00:20:21] **Nick:** boom a second ago.

[00:20:22] **Hendrik:** like,

[00:20:22] **Nick:** I was, it wasn't an eye roll. I

[00:20:24] **Hendrik:** like,

[00:20:24] **Hendrik:** what

[00:20:24] **Hendrik:** was

[00:20:25] **Hendrik:** I,

[00:20:25] **Hendrik:** I

[00:20:25] **Hendrik:** think

[00:20:26] **Hendrik:** people

[00:20:26] **Hendrik:** are

[00:20:26] **Robbie Wagner:** tearing

[00:20:26] **Robbie Wagner:** stuff

[00:20:26] **Robbie Wagner:** down down

[00:20:27] **Robbie Wagner:** there.

[00:20:28] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah, I mean I think that's actually

[00:20:30] **Robbie Wagner:** really

[00:20:30] **Robbie Wagner:** refreshing to not try to do everything

[00:20:32] **Robbie Wagner:** because like

[00:20:33] **Robbie Wagner:** there's so many things that are like, just run me
all day

[00:20:36] **Robbie Wagner:** and like

[00:20:37] **Robbie Wagner:** see what

[00:20:37] **Robbie Wagner:** you get

[00:20:37] **Robbie Wagner:** when you come back.

[00:20:38] **Robbie Wagner:** And

[00:20:38] **Robbie Wagner:** I'd rather you be like, Hey, this, and this might
be wrong. Here's how you can do the next thing. Instead

[00:20:44] **Robbie Wagner:** of

[00:20:44] **Robbie Wagner:** just

[00:20:44] **Robbie Wagner:** like,

[00:20:45] **Robbie Wagner:** alright, you come back and there's like

[00:20:47] **Robbie Wagner:** 50

[00:20:47] **Robbie Wagner:** change files.

[00:20:49] **Robbie Wagner:** You know, I don't know what you did. I'm

[00:20:51] **Robbie Wagner:** just,

[00:20:51] **Robbie Wagner:** it

[00:20:51] **Robbie Wagner:** runs, so

[00:20:52] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm gonna

[00:20:52] **Robbie Wagner:** accept it. Like I don't want that. I want to
actually know what the code is

[00:20:56] **Erik:** Mm-hmm. Hundred percent. Yeah.

[00:20:58] **Erik:** I, I

[00:20:58] **Erik:** I think

[00:20:59] **Erik:** we

[00:20:59] **Erik:** see that in

[00:20:59] **Erik:** [00:21:00] the,

[00:21:00] **Erik:** in the market, like it's a

[00:21:01] **Erik:** reflection of the market

[00:21:02] **Erik:** where

[00:21:03] **Erik:** we know that like we, as you know, anybody that's
following, like AI or, or, or, building

[00:21:07] **Erik:** anything with that has to do with, with large language
models at all

[00:21:10] **Erik:** We

[00:21:11] **Erik:** know

[00:21:11] **Erik:** that it's extremely a powerful technology.

[00:21:14] **Erik:** I think at this point we can just all say like, yeah, it's
not hyped to say it's a revolutionary technology. but

[00:21:19] **Erik:** the

[00:21:20] **Erik:** killer

[00:21:21] **Erik:** 100% success rate use case, no one's really

[00:21:25] **Erik:** figured out yet.

[00:21:26] **Erik:** and you know, it can definitely help you, for instance,
with like deep researches

[00:21:29] **Erik:** can be

[00:21:30] **Erik:** very,

[00:21:30] **Erik:** very

[00:21:30] **Erik:** helpful.

[00:21:31] **Erik:** but it's not gonna go make you. The presentation that's
going to like, win in your, your boardroom or your, your sales pitch or, and
just do all that for you. It's not gonna be your sales team for you or something
like that.

[00:21:43] **Erik:** and

[00:21:43] **Erik:** so

[00:21:44] **Erik:** I

[00:21:44] **Erik:** think

[00:21:44] **Erik:** people

[00:21:45] **Erik:** are,

[00:21:45] **Erik:** starting to, a lot of these companies are, are taking this
kind of scattershot kind of approach

[00:21:50] **Erik:** and

[00:21:50] **Erik:** seeing

[00:21:50] **Erik:** what

[00:21:50] **Erik:** sticks.

[00:21:51] **Erik:** whereas, you know, kind of

[00:21:52] **Erik:** going back to what

[00:21:53] **Erik:** I was saying earlier. Like, I, I really, really like tools
that do

[00:21:56] **Erik:** one

[00:21:56] **Erik:** thing

[00:21:56] **Erik:** and do

[00:21:56] **Erik:** it

[00:21:56] **Erik:** well.

[00:21:57] **Erik:** if you do that, if you're just good at one thing and you're
[00:22:00] really, really good and you're known to be really,

[00:22:01] **Erik:** really good

[00:22:02] **Erik:** at that

[00:22:02] **Erik:** one thing,

[00:22:03] **Erik:** great. the

[00:22:04] **Erik:** pie is

[00:22:05] **Erik:** huge for everybody. There's,

[00:22:06] **Erik:** a seat

[00:22:07] **Erik:** at the table for everybody. but if your thing is like
mediocre across the board, your only play is gonna be like, you've got
distribution already. And that's kind of like, people are like, okay. Sure. so.
I think people like we try to shoot for making as good as possible, being as
transparent as possible.

[00:22:23] **Erik:** Like we, again, going back to like the analysis chain, like
you can see what, shell

[00:22:28] **Erik:** scripts

[00:22:28] **Erik:** it came

[00:22:28] **Erik:** up

[00:22:29] **Erik:** with to, do performance analysis, like every time it's just
there.

[00:22:32] **Erik:** and I think that that's a, that's a really, really cool
thing. and it's what attracted me to

[00:22:36] **Erik:** co in the first place.

[00:22:37] **Erik:** Yeah, Yeah, for sure.

[00:22:38] **Robbie Wagner:** And I think that's good advice for almost all jobs
is find a specialty that you

[00:22:42] **Robbie Wagner:** like.

[00:22:43] **Robbie Wagner:** Because

[00:22:45] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:22:45] **Robbie Wagner:** have a failed consulting agency. We were
specialized in Ember and then kind of moved into React and Next.js and Vue and
Svelte and

[00:22:55] **Robbie Wagner:** everything. We could do everything. And then there
was like

[00:22:58] **Robbie Wagner:** No leads at that point. 'cause it's [00:23:00]
like everyone can do everything, but only some people can do the one thing
really well.

[00:23:04] **Robbie Wagner:** And

[00:23:05] **Robbie Wagner:** so

[00:23:05] **Robbie Wagner:** anyone trying to start any kind of business, that
is my advice to you.

[00:23:08] **Robbie Wagner:** Do that.

[00:23:09] **Robbie Wagner:** Do not be a generalist. Pick a thing you like and
do it very well.

[00:23:13] **CTA:** This just in! Whiskey.fund is now open for all your merch

[00:23:46] **Erik:** You guys like parks and

[00:23:47] **Erik:** recreation?

[00:23:48] **Erik:** Ron? Yes. My all time favorite quote from Ron Swanson.
Besides all the like, just hilariously funny ones. , Yeah, like life advice. Ron

[00:23:56] **Erik:** Swanson

[00:23:57] **Erik:** is

[00:23:58] **Erik:** don't half [00:24:00] ass. Two things

[00:24:00] **Erik:** full. Ask one

[00:24:01] **Erik:** thing.

[00:24:03] **Erik:** And

[00:24:03] **Erik:** I think

[00:24:03] **Erik:** that, that

[00:24:04] **Erik:** it's

[00:24:04] **Erik:** for

[00:24:04] **Erik:** business and

[00:24:05] **Erik:** for life.

[00:24:05] **Erik:** just go

[00:24:06] **Erik:** all

[00:24:06] **Erik:** in

[00:24:06] **Robbie Wagner:** on, one

[00:24:07] **Robbie Wagner:** thing.

[00:24:08] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:24:08] **Robbie Wagner:** I like the, uh. The burger one where

[00:24:11] **Robbie Wagner:** it's

[00:24:11] **Robbie Wagner:** like,

[00:24:12] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:24:12] **Robbie Wagner:** don't know, I forget exactly what I was like, the
other guy makes this like really elaborate burger and he's like, look, it's meat

[00:24:17] **Robbie Wagner:** on

[00:24:17] **Robbie Wagner:** a

[00:24:17] **Robbie Wagner:** bun.

[00:24:18] **Robbie Wagner:** Eat it.

[00:24:19] **Robbie Wagner:** It's

[00:24:19] **Robbie Wagner:** like,

[00:24:19] **Robbie Wagner:** and

[00:24:20] **Robbie Wagner:** his is

[00:24:20] **Robbie Wagner:** better.

[00:24:20] **Robbie Wagner:** They're like, oh,

[00:24:21] **Robbie Wagner:** what

[00:24:21] **Robbie Wagner:** the,

[00:24:22] **Erik:** yeah.

[00:24:23] **Erik:** He Goes

[00:24:23] **Erik:** to the breakfast

[00:24:24] **Erik:** and

[00:24:24] **Erik:** he is like, I, I want, what? What would you like? He's
like, I want all your meat. And then

[00:24:28] **Erik:** the

[00:24:28] **Erik:** guy walks away

[00:24:28] **Erik:** and

[00:24:28] **Erik:** he is like, no,

[00:24:29] **Erik:** no.

[00:24:29] **Erik:** no.

[00:24:29] **Erik:** Come back. Come back.

[00:24:29] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:24:30] **Robbie Wagner:** think

[00:24:30] **Robbie Wagner:** you

[00:24:30] **Robbie Wagner:** might

[00:24:30] **Erik:** misheard me.

[00:24:33] **Hendrik:** I

[00:24:33] **Hendrik:** just want

[00:24:34] **Erik:** clarify

[00:24:34] **Erik:** all of the

[00:24:35] **Hendrik:** meat

[00:24:35] **Hendrik:** that

[00:24:35] **Hendrik:** you have.

[00:24:38] **Hendrik:** Oh,

[00:24:39] **Hendrik:** yeah.

[00:24:39] **Hendrik:** Great

[00:24:39] **Hendrik:** show.

[00:24:39] **Hendrik:** They

[00:24:40] **Robbie Wagner:** actually

[00:24:40] **Robbie Wagner:** have a, uh, uh, is it Lagavulin? I guess that's
like

[00:24:44] **Robbie Wagner:** he has in his

[00:24:45] **Robbie Wagner:** drawer.

[00:24:45] **Hendrik:** Yeah. They

[00:24:46] **Hendrik:** have

[00:24:46] **Robbie Wagner:** Nick

[00:24:46] **Erik:** Offman edition

[00:24:47] **Nick:** No

[00:24:48] **Robbie Wagner:** like,

[00:24:50] **Robbie Wagner:** they have

[00:24:50] **Robbie Wagner:** a couple of them now, and he like, I think, goes
and

[00:24:52] **Hendrik:** collaborates

[00:24:52] **Hendrik:** with

[00:24:52] **Hendrik:** him on

[00:24:53] **Hendrik:** it.

[00:24:53] **Hendrik:** so That's so smoky though.

[00:24:54] **Hendrik:** Yeah, it is.

[00:24:55] **Nick:** Yeah.

[00:24:55] **Nick:** lack of villain's. Pretty solid

[00:24:57] **Nick:** though.

[00:24:57] **Nick:** I was gonna ask you like, so you were saying like, people
[00:25:00] were discovering the, the config file for Code Rabbit. So like you
seem to have pretty decent, sensible defaults. we don't need to go down the
laundry list, but like what are the kind of things you can actually extend or
like,

[00:25:13] **Erik:** I guess customize

[00:25:14] **Nick:** for a code rabbit?

[00:25:15] **Hendrik:** Yeah.

[00:25:16] **Erik:** that was a great question. I mean, maybe it starting into

[00:25:18] **Erik:** kind of like the, the things you might not expect that you
could customize.

[00:25:22] **Erik:** So we run a ton of

[00:25:24] **Erik:** different tools, open source

[00:25:26] **Erik:** tools,

[00:25:26] **Erik:** that, you know, security standard tools like, 'cause why
wouldn't we, if we can, if we can figure out how to. Orchestrate agents. Well
then we can just run lots and lots of tools. So we run, I think we say 40 plus
on our

[00:25:37] **Erik:** site,

[00:25:37] **Erik:** but it's, it's probably a lot more, by now, but we list
those off there.

[00:25:41] **Erik:** you can configure those in the YAML file

[00:25:44] **Hendrik:** to

[00:25:44] **Hendrik:** like

[00:25:44] **Erik:** run

[00:25:45] **Erik:** or

[00:25:45] **Erik:** not

[00:25:45] **Erik:** run if you want. which is kind of an odd thing that you
could have such control over kind of the internal workings and like what it's
doing. but if you zoom out from like kind of the, the

[00:25:54] **Erik:** AI hype

[00:25:55] **Erik:** and

[00:25:55] **Erik:** we've got

[00:25:56] **Erik:** special

[00:25:56] **Erik:** sauce

[00:25:56] **Erik:** and that what kind of everyone's doing, at the

[00:25:58] **Erik:** end

[00:25:58] **Erik:** of the day it's, it's a dev [00:26:00] tool.

[00:26:00] **Erik:** Like who really cares if it's AI under the hood? It's an
implementation detail. Like, uh, I don't,

[00:26:05] **Erik:** I was telling someone I,

[00:26:06] **Hendrik:** they

[00:26:06] **Hendrik:** were asking

[00:26:07] **Hendrik:** because we don't

[00:26:07] **Hendrik:** have

[00:26:07] **Hendrik:** a

[00:26:07] **Hendrik:** model select. and that's really, really common in AI
tools and I think

[00:26:12] **Erik:** that's

[00:26:13] **Erik:** kind of.

[00:26:13] **Erik:** F

[00:26:14] **Robbie Wagner:** Okay,

[00:26:14] **Robbie Wagner:** now

[00:26:14] **Erik:** the

[00:26:15] **Hendrik:** wine's

[00:26:15] **Hendrik:** kicking in in it. Uh, I'm gonna do some hot

[00:26:17] **Erik:** takes, but, but time, Yeah.

[00:26:19] **Erik:** Spice of time. I

[00:26:20] **Erik:** think that

[00:26:20] **Erik:** that's

[00:26:20] **Erik:** a,

[00:26:21] **Erik:** as

[00:26:21] **Erik:** a product

[00:26:22] **Erik:** developer,

[00:26:24] **Erik:** it's your responsibility to make a good product experience
and not leak implementation details, or not add cognitive load. And I don't
think that it's, right or fair. I think people should be able to tinker with the
different models.

[00:26:36] **Erik:** And play around. I think that's great to have, playgrounds
for those kinds of things and, and selection. but

[00:26:40] **Erik:** if

[00:26:40] **Erik:** you're

[00:26:40] **Erik:** building

[00:26:41] **Erik:** a product,

[00:26:42] **Erik:** you should know what model should be run. it shouldn't be
put on your users. Like, I don't open up a, a mobile app, and it's asking like,
do you want the backend to be run in Golan or is T net

[00:26:53] **Erik:** okay? you know, that, that would

[00:26:55] **Erik:** be

[00:26:55] **Erik:** so

[00:26:55] **Erik:** wild.

[00:26:57] **Erik:** Mm-hmm.

[00:26:57] **Erik:** And,

[00:26:57] **Hendrik:** you know

[00:26:58] **Erik:** know. Like,

[00:26:59] **Erik:** like [00:27:00] imagine

[00:27:00] **Erik:** like that.

[00:27:01] **Hendrik:** It's where It's like,

[00:27:01] **Hendrik:** well, I own, I,

[00:27:02] **Erik:** only,

[00:27:03] **Robbie Wagner:** actually,

[00:27:04] **Hendrik:** I

[00:27:04] **Hendrik:** only

[00:27:04] **Hendrik:** do

[00:27:04] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. I only use apps where the backend is, is
Golan personally, but.

[00:27:09] **Erik:** Like

[00:27:10] **Erik:** that's so why, like,

[00:27:10] **Erik:** I

[00:27:10] **Erik:** don't want that cognitive load when I'm using a, a dev
tool. I just want the thing to do the thing, like going back, like it, just do
the thing that you're supposed to do, do it well, and be honest and transparent
about it. Like every we, you know, going back to kind of the, do you do anything
more than code review?

[00:27:25] **Erik:** We,

[00:27:25] **Erik:** because

[00:27:26] **Erik:** we have

[00:27:26] **Erik:** that

[00:27:26] **Erik:** scaffolding, over the entire, when we know what's

[00:27:29] **Erik:** going

[00:27:29] **Erik:** on

[00:27:29] **Erik:** in the

[00:27:29] **Erik:** entire code

[00:27:29] **Erik:** base,

[00:27:31] **Erik:** we can offer

[00:27:32] **Erik:** diffs

[00:27:33] **Erik:** and

[00:27:34] **Erik:** lines of code and whatnot. And you can, you

[00:27:36] **Erik:** can apply

[00:27:37] **Erik:** those, you know, you can commit it now. You can click a
button to open in new pr. You can look at the, uh, copy the diff just for
yourself.

[00:27:45] **Erik:** You can, uh, send it to an AI agent. whatever you wanna do.
'cause we know those, all the things that people would want to do in their
flows. but we always say at the top too, like, in, this is important, like two
exclamation

[00:27:55] **Erik:** points.

[00:27:56] **Erik:** Read

[00:27:56] **Erik:** important,

[00:27:58] **Erik:** always

[00:27:58] **Erik:** review

[00:27:59] **Erik:** the

[00:27:59] **Erik:** code.

[00:27:59] **Erik:** Always [00:28:00] repeat the output.

[00:28:00] **Erik:** if you just take someone's code,

[00:28:02] **Erik:** whether

[00:28:02] **Erik:** it's an AI coding agent

[00:28:04] **Erik:** or

[00:28:04] **Erik:** I remember what the intern's

[00:28:06] **Erik:** name

[00:28:06] **Erik:** that

[00:28:06] **Erik:** we,

[00:28:06] **Erik:** we

[00:28:06] **Erik:** made up,

[00:28:07] **Erik:** but

[00:28:07] **Erik:** Jerry.

[00:28:08] **Erik:** Jerry,

[00:28:08] **Erik:** and You take Jerry's.

[00:28:09] **Hendrik:** code, like, and you just,

[00:28:11] **Erik:** and you just take it

[00:28:12] **Erik:** and say

[00:28:12] **Erik:** like,

[00:28:13] **Erik:** yep, go.

[00:28:14] **Erik:** well, okay, you don't need get anymore at that point. just

[00:28:17] **Erik:** save your

[00:28:18] **Erik:** updates, to the file system and serve that to production.
Like you don't need, you don't need code review, you don't need gi

[00:28:23] **Erik:** so

[00:28:24] **Erik:** don't just

[00:28:24] **Erik:** yolo, don't

[00:28:25] **Erik:** just

[00:28:25] **Erik:** push to production, uh, off of your local, like go through
the code review process as we all have realized is very, very important, over,

[00:28:33] **Erik:** you

[00:28:33] **Erik:** know, the

[00:28:33] **Erik:** course

[00:28:34] **Erik:** of.

[00:28:35] **Erik:** The history

[00:28:35] **Erik:** of software. And don't just take your coding agent's code.
Don't just take code rabbit's code and say, yep, that's the right thing.
although

[00:28:42] **Erik:** I will

[00:28:43] **Erik:** say

[00:28:43] **Erik:** Bun

[00:28:44] **Erik:** Js,

[00:28:44] **Erik:** user

[00:28:45] **Erik:** of

[00:28:45] **Erik:** Code Rabbit, my favorite commit message that I've, seen in,
in my short time so far at Code Rabbit is on a Bun PR where, it's Jared.

[00:28:55] **Erik:** Shout out to Jared. Massive respect. Like

[00:28:57] **Erik:** one of the

[00:28:57] **Erik:** people

[00:28:57] **Erik:** I've been following for

[00:28:58] **Erik:** so

[00:28:58] **Erik:** long,

[00:28:58] **Erik:** he is so freaking smart[00:29:00]

[00:29:00] **Erik:** So,

[00:29:00] **Erik:** gosh. And

[00:29:01] **Erik:** man,

[00:29:01] **Erik:** he is just

[00:29:02] **Erik:** like,

[00:29:02] **Erik:** not to, to promote the kind of, work life balance kind of
thing, but it seems like

[00:29:06] **Robbie Wagner:** he's a

[00:29:07] **Robbie Wagner:** NightOwl. He'll

[00:29:08] **Robbie Wagner:** be

[00:29:08] **Erik:** min, I

[00:29:08] **Erik:** don't think

[00:29:09] **Erik:** he's

[00:29:09] **Robbie Wagner:** he's

[00:29:09] **Robbie Wagner:** never

[00:29:09] **Robbie Wagner:** slept. Yeah.

[00:29:10] **Robbie Wagner:** he's, he's,

[00:29:11] **Robbie Wagner:** you know, you

[00:29:11] **Robbie Wagner:** see the, the pictures of

[00:29:13] **Robbie Wagner:** like,

[00:29:14] **Robbie Wagner:** you

[00:29:14] **Robbie Wagner:** know, the San Francisco developers room where it's
like a

[00:29:17] **Robbie Wagner:** mattress,

[00:29:17] **Robbie Wagner:** no

[00:29:18] **Robbie Wagner:** blankets. Like

[00:29:19] **Robbie Wagner:** that's,

[00:29:19] **Robbie Wagner:** that's

[00:29:19] **Robbie Wagner:** his room. He's

[00:29:20] **Robbie Wagner:** coding

[00:29:20] **Robbie Wagner:** all day.

[00:29:21] **Erik:** I'm, I, I,

[00:29:22] **Erik:** I feel, I,

[00:29:22] **Erik:** feel,

[00:29:23] **Erik:** like

[00:29:23] **Erik:** if

[00:29:23] **Erik:** Jared

[00:29:23] **Erik:** didn't

[00:29:24] **Erik:** sleep.

[00:29:25] **Erik:** He wouldn't have a bed.

[00:29:27] **Robbie Wagner:** because that

[00:29:27] **Robbie Wagner:** would just

[00:29:27] **Erik:** be wasteful.

[00:29:29] **Robbie Wagner:** true. So maybe he has no bed. He has a chair to
rest

[00:29:31] **Robbie Wagner:** occasionally,

[00:29:32] **Robbie Wagner:** but

[00:29:32] **Erik:** sorry.

[00:29:33] **Erik:** George.

[00:29:34] **Robbie Wagner:** no. Yeah. These are,

[00:29:35] **Erik:** we're

[00:29:35] **Erik:** saying

[00:29:36] **Erik:** good

[00:29:36] **Erik:** things

[00:29:36] **Erik:** about him.

[00:29:36] **Erik:** Yeah, Yeah,

[00:29:37] **Erik:** Like ma, massive respect. And, and it's this, PR is opened,
to fix like deep internal thing. they've got robo bun, which if you want to just
see just how far you can take a.

[00:29:48] **Erik:** a bot that can be specialized in your library

[00:29:50] **Erik:** or framework and just build it as a, as a GitHub app. Like
robo Button is really, really cool. you can see it on all their prs. but it's,
all these tests that it's gone through, [00:30:00] like scrolling, it's like a
hundred or probably more than that things.

[00:30:02] **Erik:** And a human river is not gonna look, go over. Plus it's
Jared. Like, you don't wanna be like, Hey, Jared, there might be a problem in
your

[00:30:08] **Erik:** code.

[00:30:09] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:30:10] **Erik:** you better

[00:30:10] **Erik:** be

[00:30:10] **Erik:** correct

[00:30:11] **Erik:** if you say

[00:30:12] **Erik:** yeah, I like, I

[00:30:12] **Erik:** don't,

[00:30:13] **Erik:** I don't have

[00:30:13] **Erik:** the

[00:30:13] **Erik:** courage.

[00:30:13] **Erik:** I know like all

[00:30:14] **Erik:** the, the, the people on the BUN team definitely do, but, I
would be like, just imposter.

[00:30:17] **Erik:** Someone would take over.

[00:30:18] **Erik:** but, first comment from

[00:30:20] **Erik:** code rabbit's critical.

[00:30:21] **Erik:** there's a,

[00:30:21] **Erik:** a memory leak here, and it's something that's internals
for, like, when you're spinning up a bunch of VMs and tearing them down, there's
a, there's a memory. So it wouldn't be anything that anyone would. A

[00:30:30] **Erik:** user

[00:30:31] **Erik:** of

[00:30:31] **Erik:** BUN

[00:30:31] **Erik:** would never

[00:30:31] **Erik:** experience.

[00:30:32] **Erik:** and it says this thing, and I remember when I was first

[00:30:35] **Erik:** scrolling,

[00:30:35] **Erik:** I was like,

[00:30:35] **Erik:** oh

[00:30:36] **Erik:** no.

[00:30:37] **Erik:** Oh no.

[00:30:37] **Erik:** are we

[00:30:38] **Erik:** gonna

[00:30:38] **Erik:** are we gonna do

[00:30:39] **Erik:** the AI

[00:30:39] **Erik:** lop

[00:30:40] **Erik:** AI spam

[00:30:41] **Erik:** thing? Like, you know, like the, like you remember Curl and
all the secure, the CVEs that were opened up, ILOP, , ai.

[00:30:47] **Erik:** ,

[00:30:47] **Erik:** I

[00:30:48] **Erik:** was like, oh no. Are

[00:30:48] **Erik:** we

[00:30:49] **Erik:** in that,

[00:30:49] **Erik:** that

[00:30:49] **Erik:** boat?

[00:30:51] **Erik:** And then

[00:30:51] **Erik:** the, it's

[00:30:52] **Erik:** a resolve thread.

[00:30:53] **Erik:** And the commit that resolves

[00:30:54] **Erik:** it

[00:30:55] **Erik:** is from Jared.

[00:30:56] **Erik:** Code Rabbit

[00:30:57] **Erik:** is

[00:30:57] **Erik:** right,

[00:30:58] **Erik:** is

[00:30:58] **Erik:** the commit

[00:30:58] **Nick:** Nice. It's [00:31:00] like,

[00:31:00] **Erik:** like,

[00:31:00] **Erik:** yes.

[00:31:01] **Nick:** that's cool though. 'cause I mean they, they, they care a
lot about performance obviously. And like, I'm impressed that. LMS are good with
Zig.

[00:31:08] **Erik:** Yeah,

[00:31:09] **Erik:** it's

[00:31:09] **Nick:** like Zig is, I mean it's

[00:31:11] **Nick:** pretty, pretty fresh. Yeah.

[00:31:13] **Nick:** Yeah. There, there,

[00:31:15] **Erik:** no joke.

[00:31:15] **Erik:** Go Rabbit

[00:31:16] **Erik:** and

[00:31:16] **Erik:** Jared

[00:31:16] **Erik:** and

[00:31:17] **Erik:** the

[00:31:17] **Erik:** rest of

[00:31:17] **Erik:** the staff.

[00:31:18] **Erik:** Yeah. Yep.

[00:31:20] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:31:20] **Erik:** think

[00:31:21] **Erik:** I

[00:31:21] **Erik:** looked up,

[00:31:21] **Erik:** I did a query on GitHub the other week and I was like, you
know, you can select the language, the, the predominant language in the, the
repo. I was like,

[00:31:28] **Erik:** okay. What

[00:31:28] **Erik:** are the, the GitHub, projects that have over 10,000 stars?

[00:31:31] **Nick:** that

[00:31:32] **Erik:** in

[00:31:32] **Erik:** predominantly

[00:31:33] **Robbie Wagner:** Zig,

[00:31:33] **Erik:** there's bun

[00:31:34] **Robbie Wagner:** bun

[00:31:34] **Erik:** well,

[00:31:34] **Erik:** there's

[00:31:34] **Erik:** Bun

[00:31:35] **Erik:** Zig Lang,

[00:31:38] **Erik:** it's the

[00:31:38] **Nick:** actually language,

[00:31:39] **Nick:** uh,

[00:31:40] **Nick:** ghost.

[00:31:40] **Erik:** Dude. Dude, I love

[00:31:41] **Erik:** this. I love,

[00:31:42] **Erik:** like,

[00:31:42] **Erik:** uh, there was a podcast he did maybe like a year ago, I
wanna say, when they were like, asked him bunch questions a bunch. It was like,
you know, after I term had released this like optional AI feature that like
everyone exploded about and it was like, guys, they did it as an optional thing.

[00:31:55] **Erik:** It's not on by default. But anyway, the

[00:31:57] **Erik:** Internet's

[00:31:57] **Erik:** usually

[00:31:58] **Erik:** really

[00:31:58] **Erik:** fair.

[00:31:59] **Erik:** And

[00:31:59] **Erik:** [00:32:00] like

[00:32:00] **Erik:** very

[00:32:00] **Erik:** balanced takes. I'm being very sarcastic.

[00:32:03] **Erik:** He is just like, yeah, man, I'm just trying to make a
really good tool they're like, what new features

[00:32:08] **Erik:** and stuff like

[00:32:08] **Erik:** that.

[00:32:08] **Erik:** And

[00:32:08] **Erik:** I was like,

[00:32:09] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah. That's it,

[00:32:10] **Robbie Wagner:** I've been thoroughly enjoying all of his
interactions. 'cause he's like, people are like, oh,

[00:32:14] **Erik:** how

[00:32:14] **Erik:** are you

[00:32:14] **Erik:** gonna

[00:32:14] **Erik:** make

[00:32:14] **Erik:** money?

[00:32:15] **Robbie Wagner:** What are you gonna

[00:32:15] **Robbie Wagner:** do with

[00:32:15] **Robbie Wagner:** this? Whatever.

[00:32:16] **Robbie Wagner:** He

[00:32:16] **Robbie Wagner:** is like,

[00:32:16] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:32:17] **Erik:** have

[00:32:17] **Erik:** three

[00:32:17] **Erik:** commas

[00:32:17] **Robbie Wagner:** in

[00:32:17] **Robbie Wagner:** my bank

[00:32:18] **Robbie Wagner:** account,

[00:32:18] **Robbie Wagner:** bro. Like,

[00:32:19] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:32:19] **Robbie Wagner:** don't

[00:32:19] **Robbie Wagner:** give a

[00:32:19] **Robbie Wagner:** shit about

[00:32:20] **Robbie Wagner:** making money,

[00:32:21] **Erik:** dude. Massive

[00:32:22] **Erik:** respect for someone that

[00:32:23] **Erik:** has just

[00:32:24] **Erik:** made

[00:32:24] **Erik:** it. Yeah. And

[00:32:25] **Erik:** made it so big. And

[00:32:28] **Erik:** then been like, you

[00:32:29] **Erik:** know

[00:32:29] **Erik:** what?

[00:32:30] **Erik:** I'm gonna just make the best possible thing. I'm gonna make
it free and open source for everybody.

[00:32:35] **Robbie Wagner:** And

[00:32:35] **Erik:** And

[00:32:36] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah,

[00:32:36] **Robbie Wagner:** we'll just

[00:32:37] **Robbie Wagner:** take it

[00:32:37] **Robbie Wagner:** from

[00:32:37] **Robbie Wagner:** there.

[00:32:37] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:32:37] **Robbie Wagner:** And scratch your own itch too. Like, he

[00:32:39] **Nick:** Yeah.

[00:32:40] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:32:40] **Erik:** It's so good. Ghostie so

[00:32:42] **Nick:** good.

[00:32:42] **Nick:** I love, I love the polishing ghostie. yeah.

[00:32:45] **Erik:** yeah.

[00:32:46] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. I, I work for, uh, HashiCorp slash I

[00:32:48] **Erik:** ibm,

[00:32:48] **Erik:** so

[00:32:49] **Erik:** we have

[00:32:49] **Robbie Wagner:** ghost

[00:32:49] **Robbie Wagner:** Deep. Oh,

[00:32:51] **Erik:** that's

[00:32:51] **Erik:** why I brought it up,

[00:32:52] **Erik:** you know?

[00:32:52] **Erik:** yeah,

[00:32:52] **Erik:** yeah,

[00:32:52] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:32:53] **Robbie Wagner:** All right. Yeah. So what's next?

[00:32:56] **Robbie Wagner:** What can

[00:32:56] **Erik:** you

[00:32:56] **Erik:** do here? I think we gotta go. We gotta go now.

[00:32:59] **Erik:** We

[00:32:59] **Robbie Wagner:** okay. [00:33:00] It's all Okay.

[00:33:01] **Robbie Wagner:** Well,

[00:33:02] **Robbie Wagner:** that's

[00:33:02] **Robbie Wagner:** fine.

[00:33:02] **Robbie Wagner:** You don't have to. No,

[00:33:03] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah, I didn't know if there's

[00:33:04] **Erik:** was, but

[00:33:05] **Erik:** if not,

[00:33:05] **Erik:** that's

[00:33:05] **Erik:** fine.

[00:33:06] **Robbie Wagner:** I can,

[00:33:06] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:33:06] **Robbie Wagner:** can,

[00:33:07] **Erik:** I was kind

[00:33:07] **Erik:** of joking.

[00:33:08] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, okay.

[00:33:08] **Robbie Wagner:** I dunno. Yeah.

[00:33:09] **Erik:** lets hear

[00:33:10] **Erik:** the

[00:33:10] **Erik:** whole yeah. Okay. The whole roadmap. All the inners, you

[00:33:12] **Nick:** you know

[00:33:12] **Nick:** how

[00:33:13] **Nick:** it works

[00:33:13] **Erik:** under the hood.

[00:33:13] **Robbie Wagner:** hood? This is one prompt.

[00:33:15] **Robbie Wagner:** No, it's

[00:33:15] **Erik:** That's Jerry.

[00:33:16] **Erik:** Jerry Jerry Row. Yeah.

[00:33:18] **Nick:** Uh.

[00:33:18] **Erik:** so, one thing that's on, on my plate is, I've been trying
to get a lot of feedback here from, from folks is that,

[00:33:23] **Erik:** we are, big proponents of open source.

[00:33:25] **Erik:** I think I mentioned the, it's free for open source forever
by default. we also, We pledged $200,000. I think we made that pledge in
February. as just

[00:33:35] **Erik:** cash,

[00:33:36] **Nick:** not

[00:33:36] **Nick:** credits,

[00:33:38] **Erik:** cash to open

[00:33:39] **Erik:** source

[00:33:39] **Erik:** maintainers, because

[00:33:40] **Erik:** open source maintainers, they need resources. We all know
that, that they're starve for resources.

[00:33:44] **Erik:** I mean, it's, it's basically the most of it is volunteer.
and you do have, you know, great organizations and like the Linx Foundation, et
cetera, that

[00:33:51] **Erik:** have made

[00:33:52] **Erik:** kind

[00:33:52] **Erik:** of this

[00:33:53] **Erik:** model

[00:33:53] **Erik:** over

[00:33:53] **Erik:** that.

[00:33:53] **Erik:** So it's not that you, they need your product more than
anything else.

[00:33:57] **Erik:** It's, they need money, they need and money can [00:34:00]
get them what they need and they know what they need best of all. So we made
that pledge and then we upped it. , We announced their series B last month. and
at the same time we said, okay, we're gonna

[00:34:11] **Erik:** up the

[00:34:11] **Erik:** pledge to a million dollars.

[00:34:13] **Nick:** Dang.

[00:34:13] **Erik:** Million dollars. , I don't have the exact numbers, but, ,
we're a little over $600,000 so far.

[00:34:18] **Nick:** I'll

[00:34:18] **Nick:** put

[00:34:19] **Nick:** on the Okay.

[00:34:20] **Erik:** sorry. Arvind, my

[00:34:21] **Erik:** boss.

[00:34:21] **Erik:** Uh,

[00:34:23] **Erik:** been busy this

[00:34:24] **Nick:** He's like, I, I don't remember agreeing to a million
dollars.

[00:34:27] **Robbie Wagner:** actually it

[00:34:27] **Robbie Wagner:** was a

[00:34:28] **Robbie Wagner:** trillion

[00:34:28] **Erik:** Yeah. Yeah. One truly,

[00:34:29] **Erik:** that's

[00:34:30] **Erik:** the

[00:34:30] **Erik:** pinky.

[00:34:30] **Erik:** Now

[00:34:30] **Erik:** we

[00:34:30] **Erik:** got

[00:34:30] **Erik:** the pinky. Yeah. but, for real, like what I've been trying
to do is get, get feedback because, I've contributed to open source for. Most of
my career, I've gotten a lot out of contributing. Not just the, like, I'm
contributing and it feels good, which is a great feeling.

[00:34:42] **Erik:** And it could be motivation in itself, but I've learned so
much. 'cause if you're at a, uh, you know, one company or maybe you know, it's
your third job, if it's your third job, you've seen how to do things

[00:34:52] **Erik:** three

[00:34:53] **Erik:** times.

[00:34:55] **Erik:** If you go look at open source, you can see an infinite
amount of ways to do the thing that you're [00:35:00] doing, even if it's the
same language.

[00:35:01] **Erik:** Frameworks, tools, everything could be exactly the same in
the stack. It's gonna be different. Maybe it's the, business logic a little
different. Maybe the product space a little different. , Data models, like how
things are flowing through, through the application, say et cetera, design
patterns, all those things.

[00:35:14] **Erik:** You can just learn those things. You don't have, like, a
lot of people are like, how do I start contributing

[00:35:18] **Erik:** to

[00:35:18] **Erik:** open

[00:35:18] **Erik:** source?

[00:35:19] **Erik:** you can reap massive benefits for your own development just
by reading open source. but what

[00:35:24] **Erik:** I've been trying to do in that the third time, trying to
come back to my, my

[00:35:27] **Erik:** train

[00:35:27] **Erik:** of

[00:35:27] **Erik:** thought,

[00:35:28] **Erik:** uh,

[00:35:29] **Erik:** get product feedback.

[00:35:30] **Erik:** Because at the end of the day, it is code, it is code
review. But there are discreet differences between, For

[00:35:35] **Robbie Wagner:** profit.

[00:35:36] **Robbie Wagner:** That's

[00:35:36] **Robbie Wagner:** the

[00:35:36] **Robbie Wagner:** word

[00:35:36] **Erik:** looking for.

[00:35:37] **Nick:** Pro, pro

[00:35:38] **Hendrik:** I think

[00:35:39] **Erik:** profi. Uh,

[00:35:40] **Erik:** yeah.

[00:35:41] **Nick:** Got gotta

[00:35:42] **Nick:** get those three commas in my bank account.

[00:35:44] **Erik:** yeah,

[00:35:45] **Erik:** Uh,

[00:35:45] **Erik:** you

[00:35:45] **Erik:** can

[00:35:46] **Erik:** move

[00:35:46] **Erik:** to

[00:35:46] **Erik:** countries that have, uh, higher

[00:35:47] **Erik:** denominations.

[00:35:48] **Nick:** yeah, Exactly. Yeah.

[00:35:49] **Hendrik:** yeah.

[00:35:49] **Hendrik:** Shout

[00:35:50] **Robbie Wagner:** out

[00:35:50] **Robbie Wagner:** Zimbabwe.

[00:35:50] **Hendrik:** Let's go. Let's go.

[00:35:52] **Erik:** trillionaire.

[00:35:53] **Hendrik:** we should do that. Remember the Silicon Valley show? How
is this guy Ara Haman? Yeah. He comes on, he goes, comas. Today's comas the
tequila. [00:36:00] Next time

[00:36:01] **Hendrik:** We

[00:36:02] **Erik:** did,

[00:36:02] **Erik:** we did

[00:36:02] **Erik:** actually make it. Uh, so Har jokes, our CEO, uh, shout out
to Harjo. Uh, just

[00:36:08] **Erik:** great.

[00:36:09] **Erik:** Just a great guy to work with. super technical. And on the
business side is just kind of just someone that's very inspirational.

[00:36:15] **Hendrik:** he's

[00:36:16] **Hendrik:** he's

[00:36:16] **Hendrik:** in

[00:36:16] **Hendrik:** the PRS himself.

[00:36:17] **Hendrik:** Yes.

[00:36:18] **Erik:** Yes.

[00:36:19] **Erik:** yes. On Monday

[00:36:21] **Erik:** last

[00:36:21] **Erik:** week. Yeah. I

[00:36:21] **Erik:** need

[00:36:22] **Erik:** more wine.

[00:36:23] **Erik:** I need to focus. Uh, Monday last week, OpenAI had their
OpenAI dev day. Uh, which is like their, the WDC of, of OpenAI, you know, kinda
like Apple's yearly developer conference.

[00:36:33] **Erik:** he was a, a main stage speaker talking about, code review
and, literally the whole presentation, besides like kind of a shout out at the
end to like, what we publish about gbd five, GB five codes. Kind of him, him
repeating those things about what we find there is we just look through open,
open source repos.

[00:36:48] **Erik:** It's just, that was the talk. here's how this open source
project used it. Here's how it detected a memory leak here. Here's how they've
customized it a little bit. like, it's just so cool to, to do that. And so
rewarding day to day

[00:36:59] **Erik:** that

[00:36:59] **Erik:** you

[00:36:59] **Erik:** can just

[00:36:59] **Erik:** [00:37:00] be like,

[00:37:00] **Erik:** oh,

[00:37:00] **Erik:** like

[00:37:01] **Erik:** we're just helping people.

[00:37:03] **Erik:** And people like, really like the power. We had someone
coming up, yesterday, twice, from a, uh, I don't want to necessarily shout 'em

[00:37:09] **Erik:** out

[00:37:09] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:37:10] **Erik:** on, the live stream,

[00:37:10] **Erik:** but

[00:37:10] **Erik:** like.

[00:37:11] **Robbie Wagner:** him

[00:37:11] **Robbie Wagner:** under

[00:37:11] **Robbie Wagner:** the bus.

[00:37:12] **Erik:** Well,

[00:37:12] **Erik:** it, it,

[00:37:12] **Erik:** would

[00:37:13] **Erik:** be more

[00:37:13] **Erik:** like a, a,

[00:37:14] **Erik:** celebration, uh, of him. But like, I, I don't wanna
necessarily call him out, but, because, uh, they do open source work , and
closed source work.

[00:37:19] **Erik:** and they started using Code Rabbit. He loved it. He was
like, he was, he was the one that, that gave me this like 50 50

[00:37:26] **Erik:** hit

[00:37:26] **Erik:** rate and this take that. Like, that's really good. And so
he was saying this while I was talking to somebody. , He came up and was just
like, we love you guys. And I was, I was kind of talking about stuff with him
and he.

[00:37:36] **Erik:** He just started talking about how they're using it,

[00:37:38] **Erik:** and I

[00:37:39] **Erik:** just like backed

[00:37:39] **Erik:** away. I was like, great. Now we got a fifth person

[00:37:42] **Erik:** at

[00:37:42] **Erik:** the booth.

[00:37:42] **Erik:** Like,

[00:37:43] **Erik:** dude, you know? And it was, uh, you know, a, a project that
people would be familiar with, , this gentleman works on. so it was just really
cool to hear, you know, him say, yeah, the first time we tried it, it was 50 50
and we're

[00:37:54] **Erik:** like,

[00:37:55] **Erik:** this

[00:37:55] **Erik:** is great.

[00:37:55] **Erik:** It just works for us. And then they're going through the
configuration, making it better and better for themselves. You know, [00:38:00]
you use the chat. If you say something like, Hey, on this one we're, we're using
this library in this way. We always want that to happen. Code Rabbit will kind
of look, try to understand what you're saying.

[00:38:10] **Erik:** And most of the time if you, you say something like, I
won't always want you to do this, or maybe it'll just infer it from your
comments. It'll create a learning. And that's another thing that's transparent,
another carrot, that shows you the learning. That it has had, and you can manage
those, in the dashboard, you can see all of them.

[00:38:25] **Erik:** And they all are attributed to like, who is the person that
I learned this from? Where's the link to like the PR or the issue or wherever I
learned this from? And then what is the learning that I'm applying every time
I'm doing code review? And so you can do that. That's like the quickest and
easiest way, to just have it start customizing to your, your needs.

[00:38:42] **Erik:** and then the more you use it or the more history you have
in your prs, the more it can kind of generate context of. Okay. How does this
team operate? What do they actually care about? Maybe they don't care about
memory leaks.

[00:38:53] **Robbie Wagner:** Like don't

[00:38:54] **Robbie Wagner:** tell

[00:38:54] **Robbie Wagner:** me about

[00:38:54] **Erik:** memory leaks. Yeah. Yeah. It, It, it's

[00:38:56] **Erik:** it's

[00:38:57] **Erik:** client side who

[00:38:58] **Erik:** cares? Like,

[00:38:59] **Erik:** ,

[00:38:59] **Erik:** It

[00:38:59] **Erik:** won't be [00:39:00]

[00:39:00] **Erik:** yeah. Memory. It's okay.

[00:39:01] **Erik:** Yeah. Uh,

[00:39:03] **Erik:** so yeah, you just download some more, just have a download
link. yeah, like it is just so cool that, so many people, , come up as I'm, I'm
sure you have this experience too, where it's people are just like.

[00:39:12] **Erik:** I really

[00:39:13] **Erik:** like your thing.

[00:39:14] **Erik:** And then they start talking to someone else about, you
know, that you're trying to talk to, that's never heard

[00:39:18] **Hendrik:** of

[00:39:18] **Hendrik:** Code Rabbit.

[00:39:18] **Hendrik:** And

[00:39:19] **Erik:** And yeah,

[00:39:20] **Hendrik:** it's a great position to be in as a dev rail person when
you have so many.

[00:39:23] **Hendrik:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm, I'm saying this, I, I came
before from a smaller startup where I had to, to work. I was working as a
software engineer and as a dev rail person, which made it easy for me to sell
because I knew the product so well 'cause I was so deep in the code. but over
here it's just, um, it's just fluent.

[00:39:39] **Hendrik:** Um, 'cause I feel like the, the product really hits the
spot where, where people are right now feeling a lot of pain. Yeah. And, and you
can feel that when people come up and they get excited about talking about your
product and then you get excited talking about your product and then everybody
gets excited.

[00:39:52] **Hendrik:** Uh, that's,

[00:39:53] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah. cool.

[00:39:54] **Hendrik:** It's good to be around.

[00:39:55] **Robbie Wagner:** Alright. We're about at time. Where can people try
it out?

[00:39:58] **Hendrik:** What,

[00:39:58] **Hendrik:** Where

[00:39:58] **Hendrik:** should

[00:39:58] **Hendrik:** they

[00:39:58] **Hendrik:** go to check

[00:39:59] **Hendrik:** out?[00:40:00]

[00:40:00] **Erik:** Uh, you can go to Code Rabbit ai. You can also,

[00:40:03] **Erik:** go. To code rapid.com, which will redirect you to code
rapid.ai.

[00:40:06] **Robbie Wagner:** and.com is not what you lead with. I wanted to

[00:40:09] **Robbie Wagner:** know that it's ai, I

[00:40:10] **Erik:** fewer tokens,

[00:40:11] **Erik:** fewer

[00:40:11] **Erik:** tokens.

[00:40:11] **Nick:** yeah. Yeah.

[00:40:13] **Erik:** and

[00:40:13] **Erik:** then, uh, yeah, just log in

[00:40:15] **Erik:** log in with your GitHub. And then, uh, you're just good to
go. Again, free for open source forever. we have like a free tier and a light
tier

[00:40:23] **Hendrik:** and

[00:40:23] **Hendrik:** a

[00:40:23] **Hendrik:** pro tier

[00:40:24] **Erik:** and

[00:40:24] **Erik:** then a

[00:40:25] **Erik:** you know, classic enterprise contact us. But that pro

[00:40:28] **Erik:** tier

[00:40:28] **Hendrik:** mystery prize, yeah.

[00:40:29] **Erik:** Mr. How much,

[00:40:32] **Robbie Wagner:** how

[00:40:32] **Robbie Wagner:** much

[00:40:32] **Hendrik:** would you

[00:40:33] **Hendrik:** think

[00:40:33] **Hendrik:** it

[00:40:33] **Hendrik:** should be? Yeah.

[00:40:34] **Hendrik:** How

[00:40:34] **Hendrik:** much

[00:40:34] **Hendrik:** money

[00:40:34] **Erik:** you

[00:40:35] **Erik:** Actually,

[00:40:35] **Erik:** someone, someone came up to me today and they asked me how
much it cost and then they answered their own question before I said anything.
They're like, it's like a thousand dollars a

[00:40:43] **Hendrik:** a year

[00:40:43] **Hendrik:** or something.

[00:40:43] **Hendrik:** I

[00:40:43] **Hendrik:** was

[00:40:44] **Erik:** like,

[00:40:45] **Erik:** oh man, we gotta go back to the, the sales team and update

[00:40:48] **Erik:** those

[00:40:48] **Erik:** prices. It's, uh, because it's. For the pro tier, it's,
it's $24 a month. If you pay annually, $30 a month. If you wanna go month, a
month, 14 day free pro tile, so you can run it on your private repos, et cetera.
but again, if [00:41:00] it's open source,

[00:41:01] **Erik:** if it's

[00:41:01] **Erik:** just a

[00:41:01] **Erik:** public repo,

[00:41:02] **Erik:** it's free by default forever.

[00:41:04] **Erik:** and then the free tier, if

[00:41:05] **Erik:** you

[00:41:06] **Erik:** do

[00:41:06] **Erik:** the 14

[00:41:06] **Erik:** day pro trial and you, you have your repos private, that'll
still give you like summaries and some basic things, but it won't do the code
review. It won't give you like the ability to chat, things like that. you can
also just download the CLI or the, the BS code or, cursor winds have extension
and it's rate limited, so to prevent abuse.

[00:41:24] **Erik:** but it's free. , I think it's like one an hour is the rate
limit, so it's still gonna be helpful for you. and there it's just, you know,
sign in with GitHub and

[00:41:34] **Hendrik:** you're good

[00:41:35] **Hendrik:** to go.

[00:41:35] **Erik:** So.

[00:41:36] **Erik:** And if you're in the market, this is like the sales team.
If they hear this, they won't. but

[00:41:41] **Hendrik:** just

[00:41:41] **Hendrik:** try. Come on.

[00:41:42] **Hendrik:** Sales

[00:41:42] **Hendrik:** team,

[00:41:42] **Hendrik:** listen

[00:41:43] **Hendrik:** to

[00:41:43] **Hendrik:** the

[00:41:43] **Hendrik:** podcast.

[00:41:44] **Erik:** Just try.

[00:41:45] **Erik:** Yeah,

[00:41:45] **Erik:** We, we actually

[00:41:46] **Hendrik:** get

[00:41:46] **Hendrik:** a hundred

[00:41:46] **Hendrik:** percent

[00:41:47] **Erik:** commission

[00:41:47] **Erik:** on

[00:41:47] **Erik:** all the open source

[00:41:48] **Erik:** projects

[00:41:49] **Erik:** that,

[00:41:49] **Erik:** that use us. that's why they don't send the sales

[00:41:51] **Erik:** team. 'cause

[00:41:51] **Hendrik:** it's

[00:41:51] **Hendrik:** $0.

[00:41:52] **Erik:** Um,

[00:41:53] **Erik:** no, Oh yeah. The sales team will hate me for saying this
one thing, this one thing sales teams don't want you to know or [00:42:00] don't
want you to say. If you

[00:42:00] **Hendrik:** work

[00:42:00] **Hendrik:** there.

[00:42:01] **Erik:** try out all, if you're in the market and you want to try
code review,

[00:42:04] **Hendrik:** just

[00:42:05] **Hendrik:** try

[00:42:05] **Hendrik:** them

[00:42:05] **Erik:** all

[00:42:05] **Erik:** out.

[00:42:06] **Hendrik:** Just

[00:42:07] **Hendrik:** do

[00:42:07] **Hendrik:** it.

[00:42:07] **Erik:** most of 'em have some kind of free tier or, free trial or
something like that.

[00:42:11] **Erik:** Set up a repo, make it a public repo, but go fork, a large
open source repo so you can kind of see what would this be like in production.
And then have Code Rabbit have all the other other ones you want to check

[00:42:22] **Erik:** out

[00:42:23] **Erik:** on there.

[00:42:23] **Erik:** Do just set that like Monday you're gonna do this and set
'em all up and then let it run.

[00:42:29] **Erik:** Play with it and see what you get from for different ones.
Um, we did have an open source maintainer tweet out, Simon Farid from Assistant

[00:42:35] **Erik:** ui,

[00:42:36] **Hendrik:** uh, which

[00:42:36] **Hendrik:** is

[00:42:36] **Erik:** like.

[00:42:37] **Erik:** Probably like if you're doing any chat GPT or claw like
thing, you want a chat, you want to interact with any of these LLM , API
providers. you want artifacts, like all that kind of stuff.

[00:42:47] **Erik:** It's a UI library and they also have a runtime as well in
there to kind of handle all of the, the different API providers and whatnot.

[00:42:54] **Hendrik:** Just tweet

[00:42:54] **Erik:** out,

[00:42:55] **Erik:** one of the like least, , appreciated features of Code
Rabbit is that [00:43:00]

[00:43:00] **Erik:** it

[00:43:00] **Erik:** detects.

[00:43:02] **Erik:** Other

[00:43:02] **Hendrik:** code review

[00:43:03] **Erik:** bots

[00:43:04] **Erik:** and like our

[00:43:05] **Erik:** whole

[00:43:05] **Erik:** thing is to not add spam, right?

[00:43:07] **Erik:** It's to be helpful and supportive. So by, even if you

[00:43:10] **Erik:** have auto review

[00:43:10] **Erik:** set on, if it detects that someone else is, that there's
another, , bot that's doing code

[00:43:15] **Erik:** review, it will

[00:43:17] **Erik:** say, okay,

[00:43:18] **Erik:** I'll hold off.

[00:43:19] **Erik:** it. Just a little comment and says, I'll hold off if you
want me to just say review, at co rabbit review

[00:43:23] **Erik:** it'll do its full review and everything

[00:43:24] **Erik:** like

[00:43:24] **Erik:** that,

[00:43:26] **Nick:** wanna scroll through

[00:43:27] **Erik:** through

[00:43:28] **Erik:** bot messages, you know, pages and pages and pages,

[00:43:31] **Nick:** they
