Whiskey Web and Whatnot. Do not adjust your set.

[00:00:36] **Jason:** We are live right now. Holy cow. , We don't have the fun
intro today, but we have an even better intro. We have the one, the only whiskey
web and whatnot slash tech commute collab. What's up, Robbie

[00:00:50] **Robbie Wagner:** what's up The cabernet

[00:00:52] **Robbie Wagner:** commute. Yes.

[00:00:53] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Cabernet

[00:01:10] **Robbie Wagner:** from, , I don't know. I don't know anything else
about it.

[00:01:12] **Jason:** from Costco.

[00:01:13] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, it actually is. I get most of my wine from
Costco. Yeah, they have good wine. It's not Costco brand. It's

[00:01:18] **Robbie Wagner:** like,

[00:01:18] **Jason:** No, it's not Kirkland's signature Cabernet, which would be
fantastic, but while he, oh, I love that. Listen to that. A SMR.

[00:01:28] **Robbie Wagner:** Pass it down.

[00:01:29] **Jason:** We're burying the headline here. , It's probably because
the headline's actually just below the table on a booster seat.

[00:01:37] **Jason:** Yeah.

[00:01:37] **Jason:** Ladies and gentlemen, welcome the one, the only Roxana.

[00:01:43] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** oh, Ana Maria Rodriguez

wondering,

[00:02:09] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** not on

[00:02:09] **Jason:** your shirt is indicating otherwise

[00:02:12] **Robbie Wagner:** Hey, it's, it's like, uh, same color as this,

[00:02:15] **Robbie Wagner:** it's fine.

[00:02:16] **Robbie Wagner:** It's

[00:02:16] **Jason:** Um, Roxy, we're, we're gonna deep dive in here, but let's,
let's maybe do a Cheers. You wanna do a toast first? Chuck? Chuck and Robbie,

[00:02:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** what?

[00:02:27] **Jason:** Chuck.

[00:02:28] **Jason:** Jesus Christ.

[00:02:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Chuck?

[00:02:30] **Robbie Wagner:** I don't have,

[00:02:31] **Robbie Wagner:** uh, I don't have any, uh, toast ready

[00:02:33] **Robbie Wagner:** for you, but.

[00:02:34] **Jason:** That's fine. That's fine.

[00:02:35] **Jason:** So Roxy, why don't you introduce yourself to everybody
that doesn't know who you are.

[00:02:40] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I'm Roxy. I used to work in film.

[00:02:44] **Jason:** too soon.

[00:02:47] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I work in education. I am making the
transition into tech and I talk about the tube feed tracker a lot 'cause that's
like what I've put out there.

[00:02:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I have a talk in a couple weeks at
Magnolia Comp,

[00:02:58] **Jason:** Shout out to

[00:02:59] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah, [00:03:00] one of the conferences in
October.

[00:03:02] **Jason:** one of the

[00:03:03] **Jason:** many, one of the many.

[00:03:04] **Jason:** , Roxy, talk to us a little bit about your background.
Obviously in tech commute, we kind of deep dive that, and I wanna know. Why
tech? What were you doing before that? , Where are you transitioning from?

[00:03:15] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** from Education.

[00:03:18] **Jason:** Education. Um,

[00:03:19] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** yeah, so I, used to be a math teacher, a
middle school math teacher, and then when we started having children, I.

[00:03:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Transitioned

[00:03:27] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** into the library in Texas, you have to
have a master's in library and information science to be a librarian, which is
super ironic at the moment.

[00:03:35] **Jason:** Why is that ironic

[00:03:36] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Why is that? Because they're mostly just
burning books over there. But, you know,

[00:03:40] **Jason:** geez. I think you're

[00:03:42] **Robbie Wagner:** That's, that's the

[00:03:43] **Robbie Wagner:** best way to consume the knowledge. Yeah.

[00:03:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** but yeah, so I've been in the library for
a few years now and it's great because. you know, I don't have a, I'm not tied
to a classroom, so I have a little more freedom to do stuff like

[00:03:54] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** this. And, , yeah, so I dabbled in
[00:04:00] web development, like super basic stuff, like everyone says, like
MySpace. I had a live journal, stuff like that. And then I took a web
development course as part of my master's program and one of the girls in my
class needed a lot of help. And so that was really fun and I was like, oh my
gosh, I forgot that I really love doing this.

[00:04:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And one of the roles as a librarian, you
do, you do so much stuff, like it's not just books. so,

[00:04:22] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I manage the title budget at my school and
like, it's a lot of documentation and paperwork and like chasing people around.
And, , I also do the website and social media for our school. And so like, I
usually do a lot of the graphics so I managed the website and so that's also
been like super cool. And then through that, people at Lela's at my kids' school
found out that I was trying to transition to tech. And so now I volunteer with
like PTO, I'm gonna do their auction website. And then, through that I am also
volunteering with the Houston area suicide.

[00:04:54] **Jason:** prevention,

[00:04:56] **Robbie Wagner:** prevention.

[00:04:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah. It's the prevention. It's the
prevention [00:05:00] coalition. Well, I was trying to remember if it was

[00:05:01] **Jason:** awareness Wait, so Hughes,

[00:05:03] **Jason:** HSPC?

[00:05:05] **Robbie Wagner:** Yes.

[00:05:05] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah. But yeah,

[00:05:07] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** so I am, so I, I do, uh, help out with
their website as well. Um, yeah, the prevention look, I thought, I was like, is
it awareness or prevention?

[00:05:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Because you can.

[00:05:16] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Just like this, this is a time we need to
not have a pause,

[00:05:19] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** pause. No. So what's awful is like
whenever I'm writing notes or like trying to schedule something, like I keep
putting like suicide meeting or something and I'm like, okay, this is like,
probably need to

[00:05:31] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** put

[00:05:32] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** the

[00:05:32] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** acronym

[00:05:32] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** in there and stuff. Like lay stuff like,
oh, I have a suicide meeting at 3:00 PM today.

[00:05:38] **Jason:** Well, uh, I mean, based on what you said and how you sort
of framed it, it sounds like there's a ton

[00:05:44] **Jason:** of transferable skills there, and I'm curious, like, are
you boot camping it or how are you learning how to code?

[00:05:53] **Jason:** Obviously that like entry level course at

[00:05:56] **Jason:** college

[00:05:57] **Jason:** isn't

[00:05:57] **Jason:** gonna get you there.

[00:05:58] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah, started with free [00:06:00] code
camp and then I discovered a hundred devs and so I've been going through those
courses and I'm a really big part of that community now. there's the whole

[00:06:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** series

[00:06:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** going on

[00:06:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that's, I think it's kind series

[00:06:13] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I think it's kind of on hold. No, I think
it's kind of on, I think it's kind of on hold right now because of the, , 'cause
of hunt tober, which is super cool.

[00:06:21] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** But yes, it's called the Chosen one series

[00:06:23] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** and it's not

[00:06:24] **Jason:** What is that? Give

[00:06:24] **Jason:** us some context. 'cause I'm sure Ravi has

[00:06:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** no idea

[00:06:27] **Jason:** the fuck you're

[00:06:27] **Robbie Wagner:** I don't, I don't,

[00:06:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** ,

[00:06:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So, you know, Leon Noelle from a hundred,
Deb.

[00:06:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** What

[00:06:35] **Robbie Wagner:** is that the Leon from the podcast with Danny? Yes.
Okay. I, I didn't know his last

[00:06:39] **Robbie Wagner:** name,

[00:06:39] **Robbie Wagner:** but I know Leon. Yeah.

[00:06:40] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:06:41] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I mean, it's

[00:06:41] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** not actually his

[00:06:42] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** last

[00:06:42] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** name,

[00:06:43] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** it's

[00:06:43] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** just

[00:06:43] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** his

[00:06:43] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** first

[00:06:44] **Jason:** if you notice. Yeah. It's just reversed.

[00:06:47] **Jason:** Leon

[00:06:48] **Jason:** Noelle. Yeah.

[00:06:50] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So in case

[00:06:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** anyone

[00:06:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** didn't

[00:06:52] **Jason:** just got that

[00:06:52] **Jason:** and you guys all got to

[00:06:53] **Jason:** see

[00:06:54] **Jason:** it

[00:06:54] **Robbie Wagner:** All right. All right. I'm done. I'll see you guys.

[00:06:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** , Yeah, so he selected somebody from
[00:07:00] the community to kind of like go through the job hunt process in
public and like you have to do everything the correct way.

[00:07:06] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So since April, like I've been correctly
job hunting. , And I've had a few interviews recently. I feel like I'm getting
close. So, it's a great program. Everybody, the community is amazing.

[00:07:18] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** We've got Lucas sitting

[00:07:19] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** over there,

[00:07:20] **Jason:** Yeah. Lucas, a hundred, a hundred devs sitting across

[00:07:23] **Jason:** from us. There's

[00:07:24] **Jason:** actually several here. Yeah.

[00:07:25] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yes.

[00:07:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Um,

[00:07:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** is

[00:07:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that?

[00:07:27] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Teron unique?

[00:07:28] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah.

[00:07:28] **Jason:** Yeah. Dewan, I think I met in, uh, the, the big No

[00:07:33] **Jason:** there's

[00:07:33] **Jason:** multiple other ones anyway.

[00:07:35] **Jason:** How has that

[00:07:35] **Jason:** been for

[00:07:36] **Jason:** you to have.

[00:07:37] **Jason:** Kind of an external support system through all of this.
Uh, a hundred devs community's obviously super supportive and positive. Being

[00:07:44] **Jason:** a member

[00:07:45] **Jason:** of myself,

[00:07:45] **Jason:** I

[00:07:45] **Jason:** totally

[00:07:46] **Jason:** understand,

[00:07:46] **Jason:** but

[00:07:46] **Jason:** like

[00:07:47] **Jason:** trying to self-teach or self-learn and then doing that
while you're working and having a family, and obviously Daniel, your, your
husband supports you, but like how important has it been for you as far
[00:08:00] as progress to have that external support as well?

[00:08:02] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah. So I've been super lucky that my
family has been extremely supportive because especially with like traveling to
conferences and. A lot of people, you know, it's like, why, why do you keep
going? Why? And and honestly, it's like an investment for myself and I've been
able to like finagle, like either discounted tickets or free tickets.

[00:08:22] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** of all the conferences I've been to, I
think I've only paid for maybe three of them. and that was mostly at the
beginning. I did pay for this one though 'cause I really enjoy a TO 'cause I
really did enjoy it last year and so I got an early bird ticket. But, Yeah, so
I'm grateful for their support.

[00:08:35] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** My, you know, obviously Daniel with the
kids and everything every day, and he tries to do it himself even though my
parents are there to help. , Yeah, my parents and my sister, and my
mother-in-law and, you know, they're all helping. So make this possible. The
Torque community has been incredibly supportive as well as the hundred devs
community that we've been talking about, although, being in the job hunt
spotlight, definitely, it takes its toll because you already have [00:09:00] I
already have all this pressure that I put on myself. And then, you know, there's
the added pressure of like, okay, like everyone's watching and waiting and
somebody over the summer compared it to like a TV show. And I'm like, okay, well
we've hit a plateau and TV show's a little boring at the

[00:09:14] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** moment, so.

[00:09:14] **Jason:** The Truman Show of code. Um, well talk about that a little
bit. Like how are you adjusting

[00:09:20] **Jason:** or how

[00:09:20] **Jason:** are

[00:09:20] **Jason:** you handling that? Because I mean,

[00:09:23] **Jason:** without it,

[00:09:24] **Jason:** this

[00:09:24] **Jason:** is already a hard process.

[00:09:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Adjusting to the what? The stress?

[00:09:28] **Jason:** No, the, public

[00:09:29] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** eye on

[00:09:29] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** your

[00:09:29] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** whole

[00:09:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Oh, journey

[00:09:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Oh. Um, so luckily, , being a mom that
works full time and like, most of my spare moments are taken like I'm on my
computer or with my kids or whatever.

[00:09:40] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I don't have a lot of time to overthink
things.

[00:09:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Shut

[00:09:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** up.

[00:09:47] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like, you know, I get imposter syndrome,
but I, it doesn't last long because I just don't have the time. Like I have to
brush it off and keep going.

[00:09:53] **Jason:** Okay. I was gonna ask what you meant by it

[00:09:55] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** doesn't

[00:09:56] **Jason:** long. How do you move past

[00:09:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** it,

[00:09:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** don't know. I guess I kind of talk to
people, talk to the [00:10:00] community. 'cause everybody you know, they go
through the same thing. And that was another thing because I feel like Leon
chose me because I'm a little more social and that's something that a lot of
people need to work on.

[00:10:13] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Like, I have tons of

[00:10:14] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** stuff

[00:10:14] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** to work on, but

[00:10:15] **Jason:** networking.

[00:10:16] **Jason:** Like what?

[00:10:18] **Jason:** No,

[00:10:18] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like, no. Like the actual studying and
coding and everything, like, you know, I can always be better. but the fact
that, you know, I'm sharing about my imposter syndrome, you know, it resonates
with, with everyone.

[00:10:31] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And I guess just being open about it, I

[00:10:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** don't know, it

[00:10:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** just kind

[00:10:34] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** of

[00:10:34] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** connects everybody.

[00:10:35] **Jason:** you finding that hard, like that vulnerability

[00:10:39] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** lately,

[00:10:40] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** , It's mostly all written out, so it's
been really easy. But the first few, like streams. When like, we were getting
into the hard hitting subject matter and working on the behavioral interview
questions and everything. I think there was like one or two where I like almost
cried. But,

[00:10:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** you

[00:10:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** know,

[00:10:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I, I was able to compose myself. Well,

[00:10:59] **Jason:** Well, let [00:11:00] me, let me ask you about that. Like,

[00:11:01] **Jason:** when you

[00:11:02] **Jason:** think about like, what caused that emotion, what was that
like,

[00:11:06] **Jason:** what was

[00:11:06] **Jason:** the action

[00:11:07] **Jason:** that caused that? Was it like the, again, like the
pressure of the situation or like the kind of that overarching theme of like

[00:11:14] **Jason:** what

[00:11:14] **Jason:** this

[00:11:14] **Jason:** process

[00:11:15] **Jason:** is

[00:11:15] **Jason:** for you.

[00:11:15] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** again, stepping

[00:11:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** outta your

[00:11:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I think I don't, yeah, I think it was
just, I can't even remember, but like, I think it was just the question that I
was answering that just kind of hit a nerve because it was, yeah.

[00:11:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I don't, I just, I don't remember the
specifics, but it was

[00:11:28] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** just coming outta

[00:11:29] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** my comfort zone I think.

[00:11:30] **Jason:** You're obviously a little bit more comfortable with doing
it now. Do you have any tips for anybody that is also struggling?

[00:11:36] **Jason:** This is a

[00:11:37] **Jason:** hard

[00:11:37] **Jason:** one. I mean,

[00:11:38] **Jason:** I, I think struggling

[00:11:39] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** what specifically?

[00:11:41] **Jason:** outta comfort zones a little bit and like getting
comfortable with being uncomfortable.

[00:11:44] **Jason:** I think

[00:11:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** yeah.

[00:11:45] **Jason:** of that in what we do.

[00:11:47] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah. So LinkedIn, , is pretty
intimidating for a lot of people

[00:11:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** and

[00:11:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** so

[00:11:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I started

[00:11:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that

[00:11:53] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** series. Your

[00:11:53] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** favorite, your favorite

[00:11:55] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** series. Called, , treating LinkedIn like a

[00:11:58] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** blog. [00:12:00] And look, somebody at CYC
stopped me and they were like, Hey, you stopped posting your blog series on
LinkedIn.

[00:12:07] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I really miss it.

[00:12:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:12:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** was

[00:12:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like,

[00:12:10] **Robbie Wagner:** what?

[00:12:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And

[00:12:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** so

[00:12:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:12:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** had

[00:12:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** to

[00:12:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** find

[00:12:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** you

[00:12:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** and

[00:12:12] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** tell

[00:12:12] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** you

[00:12:12] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** because I was like, oh my

[00:12:14] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** gosh.

[00:12:14] **Jason:** she did,

[00:12:15] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** But it worked. Like, so I posted probably
like once a week or something, just like what I was working on, what I was
doing, whatever. And it just helped, um,, because I used to be a blogger, so
like. Writing isn't that's not the hard part, it's the like putting myself out
there on LinkedIn somewhere that seems like it's totally business. that helped
me with putting myself out there on LinkedIn. And then gradually I talked about
what I was like working on and what projects I was doing, because

[00:12:40] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:12:40] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** think

[00:12:40] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that

[00:12:41] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** was the

[00:12:41] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** scarier part,

[00:12:42] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** was the building in public.

[00:12:43] **Jason:** Can you talk about that whole process again for. Your
background as far as like you've done content

[00:12:51] **Jason:** creation and

[00:12:52] **Jason:** stuff like

[00:12:52] **Jason:** that.

[00:12:52] **Jason:** what's

[00:12:53] **Jason:** what's the background there?

[00:12:54] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Oh, yes.

[00:12:54] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So I used to run a lifestyle blog,

[00:12:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** , ger feisty.com. It is since. Gone away.
Like [00:13:00] I completely wiped it from the internet. , Because like before
kids, it was like lifestyle blog and I, collaborated with brands and stuff, and
then after kids, like it became more of a mommy blog and I did a lot of brand
collabs, but it was like Pampers and, and then I talked about Sebastian and his
like condition and everything a lot and, and then I was like, you know what,
this is just a lot of information and maybe , this stuff doesn't need to be out
there, like all this private stuff about Sebastian's condition and everything.

[00:13:24] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So. I was like, whatever, I'm just gonna
delete this. And then like the next year I was like, oh, and now I want to
transition to tech and I, all, my content is completely gone. So, you know.
Cool.

[00:13:36] **Jason:** hindsight's 2020, I suppose.

[00:13:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So I still do brand some brand
collaboration on Instagram. , A lot of it is mostly like family content, but, ,
I feel like I keep it comical.

[00:13:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I'll post my kids and stuff like in
stories, but. for example, Lucas saved that picture of the, oops, your late
sign. And like everybody knows that sign now. It says, oops, you're late.
Students should

[00:13:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** be

[00:13:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** in class

[00:13:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** by seven 30.

[00:13:58] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. I've seen that a lot. Yeah, yeah, [00:14:00]
yeah. I know, I know. I've seen it. Yeah. So.

[00:14:02] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So yeah. And I, I actually took the other
day after school,

[00:14:07] **Robbie Wagner:** the

[00:14:07] **Robbie Wagner:** kids all

[00:14:07] **Robbie Wagner:** closed

[00:14:08] **Robbie Wagner:** with it.

[00:14:08] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I got a picture of that

[00:14:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** with the infamous sign because it's
freaking seven 30 in the morning.

[00:14:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** pretty early.

[00:14:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** because I look, I wake up at like four
sometimes earlier, but they just take forever or like we're out going out the
door.

[00:14:23] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Someone has to poop. Or if Sebastian's
vomiting, like

[00:14:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** it's

[00:14:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** just,

[00:14:26] **Robbie Wagner:** yep, just

[00:14:27] **Robbie Wagner:** apparently

[00:14:28] **Jason:** I never,

[00:14:30] **Robbie Wagner:** I love this.

[00:14:31] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** this

[00:14:31] **Jason:** segue

[00:14:31] **Jason:** for time management. Um.

[00:14:35] **Jason:** Let's talk

[00:14:35] **Jason:** about that though, because I think, I think that that's
something that you've probably, I don't wanna say mastered, but have certainly
worked through and

[00:14:44] **Jason:** kind of iterated

[00:14:45] **Jason:** on because

[00:14:46] **Jason:** full-time

[00:14:47] **Jason:** job,

[00:14:48] **Jason:** full-time mom

[00:14:50] **Jason:** also trying to learn like how are you

[00:14:52] **Jason:** kind of

[00:14:53] **Jason:** managing

[00:14:53] **Jason:** all of this and like still functioning.

[00:14:56] **Jason:** I'm

[00:14:56] **Jason:** not functioning,

[00:14:57] **Jason:** it's all,

[00:14:57] **Jason:** it's a facade.

[00:14:58] **Jason:** Alright, there [00:15:00] we

[00:15:00] **Jason:** go.

[00:15:01] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I suck at studying at night because I will
just get sleepy and be like, Nope. And then close my laptop. , I used to try to
study like in bed and that didn't work.

[00:15:09] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And so just, you know, you just have to
make like the changes. I set up my desk area. I got the second monitor. I
realized that like waking up early is the way to go.

[00:15:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And

[00:15:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that's why I work out in the morning,
because you don't have all the things that happen to you throughout the day that
affect your mood, that make you tired, that like, make you just be like, no,
thanks,

[00:15:25] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I'll

[00:15:25] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** do it

[00:15:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** tomorrow.

[00:15:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So, you know, I wake up at, it

[00:15:28] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** used to

[00:15:28] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** be

[00:15:28] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** three

[00:15:29] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** 30,

[00:15:29] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:15:29] **Robbie Wagner:** oof.

[00:15:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** on that, but it's, it's been four. I I
know,

[00:15:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I know. And then like, I would go to bed
like, mm, like 10 o'clock. But that's why it's been four, because lately I've
been going to bed closer to 11, which is ridiculous. I know. And so.

[00:15:43] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Like

[00:15:43] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** one night a week, I basically

[00:15:44] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like crash out

[00:15:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** at 8:00 PM and like

[00:15:47] **Jason:** It happens. I mean, it's, it's your

[00:15:48] **Jason:** body

[00:15:49] **Jason:** catching up with you though.

[00:15:50] **Robbie Wagner:** But yeah, I don't understand how like anyone, you
have to have a lot of willpower and drive to want to do that. Like. Because I'm
like, oh my God, I have one hour of free time. Ain't [00:16:00] no way I'm doing
something productive.

[00:16:01] **Robbie Wagner:** Like

[00:16:01] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm going to sit on the couch,

[00:16:03] **Jason:** Yeah.

[00:16:03] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah. well, so in the evenings I am too
tired to do any of that. So like. you know, you walk into your room just like
plop

[00:16:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** stomach down,

[00:16:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like pull

[00:16:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** out

[00:16:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** your

[00:16:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** phone and just like,

[00:16:13] **Jason:** is that

[00:16:13] **Jason:** is that you do,

[00:16:14] **Jason:** Robbie?

[00:16:15] **Robbie Wagner:** That's not

[00:16:15] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** what I

[00:16:15] **Jason:** personally do. No. you lay

[00:16:16] **Jason:** on your

[00:16:17] **Jason:** tummy and

[00:16:18] **Jason:** scroll

[00:16:18] **Jason:** TikTok

[00:16:19] **Jason:** with your

[00:16:20] **Robbie Wagner:** kicking

[00:16:20] **Jason:** your

[00:16:20] **Jason:** feet

[00:16:20] **Jason:** around

[00:16:21] **Jason:** like

[00:16:21] **Jason:** a teenage girl.

[00:16:22] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Um, no, but it's just funny because like
the way our bed is, like when you walk into the hallway, you just see my feet
like sticking off and like that's. Just what it looks like when I'm like veg
out, like my brain's going numb for a few minutes before like bedtime or dinner
or something.

[00:16:37] **Jason:** What are you doing and how do you

[00:16:39] **Jason:** find

[00:16:39] **Jason:** time to

[00:16:40] **Jason:** not be focused on something?

[00:16:42] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** how do I find time to veg out?

[00:16:44] **Jason:** Yeah, I

[00:16:45] **Jason:** don't,

[00:16:45] **Jason:** I

[00:16:45] **Jason:** just,

[00:16:46] **Jason:** it

[00:16:46] **Jason:** just

[00:16:46] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** happens.

[00:16:47] **Jason:** You just kind of, it, You

[00:16:48] **Jason:** just get it when you get it.

[00:16:50] **Jason:** Nah, I get that.

[00:16:51] **Jason:** Talk to us a little bit about. The app, the feed tube

[00:16:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Oh, okay. Well, Okay.

[00:16:59] **Jason:** Okay. well[00:17:00]

[00:17:00] **Jason:** and give us a little background, and I know,

[00:17:01] **Jason:** uh, obviously you've talked about it ad nauseum, but at
the same time, I think this is sort of important storyline material for your
journey here.

[00:17:09] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah, I know. And I just feel bad 'cause I
guess Robbie hasn't heard it 5 million times, so I'll pretend I'm only talking
to Robbie.

[00:17:15] **Jason:** Yeah.

[00:17:17] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Okay. So, . I am four 11 and three
quarters, and I had twins. , I made it to my due date. I love remembering, my
most difficult times when I was pregnant were, I worked at an elementary school
library at the time and the parking lot, was like at one end of the building

[00:17:34] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** and

[00:17:34] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** the library was

[00:17:35] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** at the

[00:17:35] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** other. So like when I walked into the
building, it was just like this massively long hallway and it felt even longer.
Because when I was pregnant with Lela, the one baby,

[00:17:46] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:17:46] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** was fine.

[00:17:47] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** It was totally, I worked out probably to
like two weeks before her due date or something with the twins. I think I had to
stop a month before.

[00:17:53] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** But it seriously felt like,

[00:17:55] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like

[00:17:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** if

[00:17:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:17:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like

[00:17:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** relaxed, they would

[00:17:58] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** just fall out.

[00:17:59] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Like that's what it [00:18:00] felt like.
And so like walking down that hallway with like this huge just stomach on this,
Small body. Um, it was one of the hardest things pre having them, like before
having them. So I was super proud that I made it to the due date.

[00:18:15] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Both of them were over five pounds, which
was the magic number, so that they wouldn't end up in the nicu. and like this
whole time, Sebastian was like hiding behind Aric, I guess. 'cause they couldn't
ever fully see his like organs and stuff. Like whenever they did X-rays, they
were just like, oh, he's hiding.

[00:18:31] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And then I think. one of the doctors
noticed that like there was more, , now I can't even remember. It was like the
fluid, there was more in Sebastian's. And normally that would happen if like
something was wrong, but like, nobody noticed it. Nobody caught it. Like my
doctor even said like, I was like the perfect twin pregnancy, whatever.

[00:18:49] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** so then they were born and , you know,
obviously they noticed something was up with Sebastian and they took him. Right
away. And I lost a ton of blood and I'm anemic. So like I even needed a
transfusion. [00:19:00] I remember when they took him like, oh, I looked so out
of it. They had him in this like crazy looking container.

[00:19:07] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** 'cause they had to take him to a different
hospital. 'cause the one where I had him didn't have like the high enough level
NICU to deal with him. I

[00:19:13] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** think they drove, I don't think they
needed to fly him, but they, yeah, they took him to the downtown hospital and So
he has bacterial association.

[00:19:21] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** VL is an acronym for seven different
conditions. And if you have three of the seven minimum, you are like in under
that umbrella AL association and it's super rare. His main one is his
respiratory condition. So I talk about that one 'cause the other one is more
private and then one of them's a non-issue anymore, so he had esophageal.

[00:19:41] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Freesia. that means his esophagus and his
trachea were connected. So like if he tried to eat or drink anything, basically
it would just all go into his lungs. Um, yeah. Yeah. So like once the umbilical
cord was gone, you know, like, so that was like the first operation and, he also
ended up having an ostomy for like [00:20:00] nine months.

[00:20:00] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** , But luckily we were able to like kind of
deal with that around the nine, 10 month mark. So anyway, the respiratory
condition. It comes with like layers. He has asthma on top of that, he has, it's
trachea. So it's basically his trachea is like super floppy and, , so he can't ,
get rid of mucus and stuff.

[00:20:19] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So like when you're sick and you're
coughing and like you blow your nose or you like cough up phlegm, like he can't
do that. So it ends up going into his lungs and he gets pneumonia. , And then he
also has a laryngeal cleft. Like all of these things are just like. Things that
are common if you already have like this one condition.

[00:20:36] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Right. So, , the laryngeal cleft we only
discovered

[00:20:39] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** After

[00:20:40] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like the most traumatic experience of our
lives. when Sebastian was like 14 months old, he was eating dinner and we were
like feeding him whatever. He starts choking. And so we're like, patting him
'cause we're used to the choking because , he has some scarring in his
esophagus.

[00:20:55] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And so like. When he swallows, it
partially swallows and [00:21:00] then like he swallows again, it's like, it's,
it's not in sync, it's like two different swallows or whatever. So it's called a
stuckey and like kids with his condition often will have stuckey where it's like
something is stuck and usually they'll be able to get it down eventually or
they'll throw it up.

[00:21:14] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** but he was choking and so like I flipped
him over and was like hitting him on his back. I could feel him going stiff. And
so like, I was like shoving my hand in his mouth and like, I felt his jaw
locking up. And like, at this point I'm like screaming for Daniel. So Daniel
grabs him and he's trying, but he's still like turning, he's turning blue at
this point.

[00:21:34] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And my mother-in-law was visiting and
she's, , CPR certified. She's a, A volunteer firefighter. So she was in her rv.
But she had like babysat them all day. So, , I think she like fell asleep early
or something. So we were like banging on the rv, like screaming. Daniel's like
doing a rescue, breathing like on Sebastian, on the hood of my car.

[00:21:54] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** , I think he like coughed or something and
like, so he, he was breathing again. I called the ambulance. [00:22:00]

[00:22:00] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I called

[00:22:00] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** 9 1 1 and the lady was like, ma'am, you
need to calm down. 'cause I think I was just like. Screaming and, I wanted to
know like how long Sebastian went without oxygen.

[00:22:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So whenever we got to the hospital, like I
rode in the ambulance with him his oxygen saturation was still super low. And
like, while we were in the, , ambulance, he was vomiting food and like you could
hear his, his chest rattling, like it was just sounding, it was like crazy. so
we got to the hospital, they took him back to the OR and while he was back
there.

[00:22:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I like looked up our ring camera and like
I, I'm pretty sure he went like at least two minutes without oxygen. to this
day, anything that like he's behind on or whatever, like he's spent so much time
in hospitals like 2022, he's like nine hospital stays and they're all like a
week or more.

[00:22:47] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** This one was three weeks because they
just, that's when they discovered the laryngeal cleft. 'cause he had completely
aspirated like his dinner into his lungs my theory because he was eating fine
and drinking and he wasn't getting sick. [00:23:00] So my theory is that when we
were like, banging on his back, trying to get him to stop choking or like
sticking our, you know, our fingers down his throat, I'm pretty sure that
whatever he had going on, I think we need it worse.

[00:23:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And I think that that's why now it became
like such a prominent thing. so anyway, he gets pneumonia a lot and all of this
to say is he. Burns a lot of calories just existing. so

[00:23:23] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that's why

[00:23:24] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** he has a G-tube now.

[00:23:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like

[00:23:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that

[00:23:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** was, that

[00:23:27] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** was the

[00:23:27] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** long version.

[00:23:28] **Jason:** No, but

[00:23:28] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** don't usually talk

[00:23:29] **Jason:** I was gonna say, I don't think you've really ever shared
that. I

[00:23:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah.

[00:23:34] **Jason:** multiple people here in the chat commenting on this.

[00:23:37] **Jason:** Um, Yeah.

[00:23:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** normally talk about

[00:23:38] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** the choking '

[00:23:39] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** cause

[00:23:39] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah, it

[00:23:40] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** normally,

[00:23:41] **Jason:** I, mean, he's a parent.

[00:23:42] **Jason:** I

[00:23:42] **Jason:** mean, I like,

[00:23:43] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** no, like the turning blue and like the,
the jaw, oh my gosh. It's like. It's super traumatic. I remember Daniel's like,
he ran, he would randomly have flashbacks, like every once in a while something
would happen and he would just like remember like, holding this blue child, you
know,

[00:23:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** it's like,

[00:23:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** and insane. yeah.

[00:23:58] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Something like

[00:23:58] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that.

[00:23:59] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** You

[00:23:59] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** know, just,

[00:23:59] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** [00:24:00] yeah.

[00:24:00] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And then when he was in the, or like the
doctor came out super stressed 'cause he was like, he almost choked again while
he was in there. Like it was, I was, it was, it was intense. But yeah, so he has
a G-tube now and he eats by mouth just fine. Like he loves.

[00:24:13] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Food I have to get on top of him because

[00:24:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Sometimes

[00:24:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** he won't even chew. He's just like eating
so much and I'm

[00:24:18] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** just like,

[00:24:19] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** child, you have

[00:24:20] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like almost

[00:24:21] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** died twice so I need you to please chew
your food.

[00:24:58] **Jason:** Jesse thinks you are [00:25:00] legit a badass by the way.

[00:25:03] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** thanks Jeff. , But yeah, so he has a
G-tube so that he can maybe grow a little bit. 'cause one of my jokes. Is that
like obviously my DNA is not, I'm sitting on my foot right now. Like my DNA is
not gonna help him, so we stopped doing the feeds 'cause he eats so much now.
So, , but that's why he has his G-tube.

[00:25:20] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And so like one of the million hospitals
states he had in like 20 22, 20 23, the night shift nurses would struggle to
figure out what the heck his feed rate should be because, even the length of
time, because he would eat dinner and he would eat breakfast. But if he feeds
like up until breakfast, he's not going to eat breakfast.

[00:25:36] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And so it's like, do you want him to get
the calories on his own or do you want him to have a knife eat? So that's like
the struggle. based on his weight, he's supposed to have like, this many
milliliters per hour, but when he's sick, that makes him throw up. And so I have
so much like bitterness towards the dieticians that would keep coming in and
being like, he needs to eat this.

[00:25:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And I'm like. You will vomit all of it if
you try to do that. [00:26:00] So anyway, I, I made the tube feed rate
calculator, like that's what it was, , the first round or the first couple
rounds. And it's helped the parents in the G-tube communities, uh, advocate for
their kids. And like, I just got a message the other day of this woman with two
babies , that have G-tubes and she was like, I can't believe this, you know,
hadn't been invented yet, or.

[00:26:21] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Created yet or whatever. And, , it was
just a really great message that, and the community that I shared it with, like
a year ago, they were also like, I'm bookmarking this. I love this, yada. And
so, uh, I recently upgraded it. I need to, or with the original site to the new,
to the upgrade because in the upgrade, , using OpenAI you can like search
specific formulas so then parents can track the calories as well as, the
milliliters and stuff.

[00:26:44] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So.

[00:26:44] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Why did you

[00:26:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** decide

[00:26:46] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** to?

[00:26:46] **Jason:** this?

[00:26:47] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I was learning to code at the time and, ,
I mean, I'm still, but I was like in the beginning stages and that's why it's
like the two V rate calculators and I was like, oh, this seems like a, like a
project I can do. And , I've always been a problem [00:27:00] solver. I don't
think it's just the math teacher in me because like, even as a librarian, like
you know, you're a resource.

[00:27:06] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I just, I always end up being a resource.
For people. So, , it just kind of seemed natural. Daniel's also a math teacher.
We both kind of were like, we're like, how are people not, I don't understand,
like, this is basic math, but at the same time it's like so many people go
around saying, I suck at math, I suck at math.

[00:27:22] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And then also, like when you're under
pressure, like you have like, I don't know how many patients in a night and
something's happening over here and over here, and you're getting information
from the dietician and the doctor and the parents. And so it's just easier

[00:27:32] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** to

[00:27:32] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** be

[00:27:32] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like.

[00:27:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Let me just put the information in

[00:27:34] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** here

[00:27:35] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** and have

[00:27:35] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** it tell

[00:27:36] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** me.

[00:27:36] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:27:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah, I

[00:27:37] **Robbie Wagner:** know how you would do

[00:27:38] **Robbie Wagner:** that

[00:27:38] **Robbie Wagner:** without a calculator.

[00:27:40] **Robbie Wagner:** Like,

[00:27:40] **Jason:** yeah.

[00:27:41] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** be like,

[00:27:41] **Robbie Wagner:** eh,

[00:27:41] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:27:41] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** guess

[00:27:42] **Robbie Wagner:** like.

[00:27:43] **Jason:** It seems wild to me that there wasn't a tool for that.
that.

[00:27:47] **Jason:** they

[00:27:47] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah.

[00:27:48] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah. And somebody in the, in one of the
tube feed communities said that they were using one that was for like, , drips,
so like a IV drip or whatever. But they were like, it's not the same as for a
tube feed. And [00:28:00] so, uh, yeah, so it's been really helpful

[00:28:03] **Jason:** how, yeah.

[00:28:04] **Jason:** How have you found, I mean, obviously you very much
advocate for your kids.

[00:28:09] **Jason:** where

[00:28:10] **Jason:** do you see the

[00:28:11] **Jason:** disconnect,

[00:28:11] **Jason:** where

[00:28:11] **Jason:** you will fight to the death for them, but then you
struggle to advocate for yourself?

[00:28:16] **Jason:** This

[00:28:17] **Jason:** is

[00:28:17] **Jason:** just

[00:28:17] **Jason:** based on conversations

[00:28:18] **Jason:** you and I have had in the past about like, again, like

[00:28:22] **Jason:** you're interviewing and

[00:28:24] **Jason:** like

[00:28:24] **Jason:** looking

[00:28:25] **Jason:** for roles or not thinking that you're good enough to be
there yet

[00:28:27] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** when

[00:28:28] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** you

[00:28:28] **Jason:** just

[00:28:28] **Jason:** put that together, like you just explained, like this

[00:28:32] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** breaking?

[00:28:33] **Jason:** app that you built.

[00:28:35] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I don't know. Well, 'cause you know, when
I first built it, it was mainly like, it came from a problem that I saw other
people having, but I kind of built it for me, I guess, because. People told me I
was, they were like, this is too personal. This is too boot campy. And so like,
I even, I wrote it down the other day.

[00:28:50] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I was like, I basically built this for
like a traumatized mother, in the hospital room at night. Like, so, you know, it
was, I made it for me and then like when other [00:29:00] people were
interested, I started having to like, make it for them as well. I just went off
on a tangent that had nothing to do with your

[00:29:06] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** question. yeah,

[00:29:07] **Jason:** didn't at all, but that's fine.

[00:29:09] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** probably Avoidance.

[00:29:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah.

[00:29:10] **Jason:** Good avoidance can appreciate that.

[00:29:14] **Jason:** I'm a

[00:29:14] **Jason:** side.

[00:29:14] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** manager. What can I say?

[00:29:16] **Jason:** Well, I mean, I, I think it's important to kind of point
that out because I think that you're a very strong advocate when it's something
you are like super passionate about, like

[00:29:27] **Jason:** your kids.

[00:29:28] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** They need

[00:29:29] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** people to advocate

[00:29:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** for them because they're too little to do
it right now. Hmm. I used to do

[00:29:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** the

[00:29:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** same for

[00:29:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** dogs beforehand and for

[00:29:35] **Jason:** for yourself

[00:29:36] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** too? I

[00:29:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** mean,

[00:29:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I do, I think that's why I post every day
on Twitter, like try to hold myself accountable. people

[00:29:42] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** have mentioned

[00:29:43] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that they like the

[00:29:43] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** consistency

[00:29:44] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** of

[00:29:44] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that.

[00:29:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I think that that's kind of what I do on
Twitter and that's what I did on LinkedIn when I used it as a blog. Like I hold
myself accountable and I try to, write about the good things. , I know you don't
wanna be unrealistic and never mention the bad things, obviously.

[00:29:58] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** It helps me and, you know, it might
[00:30:00] help other people.

[00:30:00] **Jason:** You took

[00:30:01] **Jason:** the,

[00:30:02] **Jason:** the class that was your kind of entry into it. Why go back
to that. Sorry,

[00:30:07] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Sorry,

[00:30:07] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** what

[00:30:08] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** tech,

[00:30:09] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Like you took

[00:30:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** the

[00:30:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** class

[00:30:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** in

[00:30:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** college,

[00:30:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like

[00:30:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that one

[00:30:12] **Jason:** web design or whatever class.

[00:30:13] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** but

[00:30:14] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** it was, it just reminded me of something
that I had done previously that I really liked. 'cause it was , it was a very
basic class. Like I, I got an easy A , and I was glad to help someone else
through it as well, so.

[00:30:25] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I mean, it felt easy, excuse me. Like I'm
sure obviously like some people needed help and it was great

[00:30:31] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** so

[00:30:32] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** after college, I didn't wanna go to grad
school, but I

[00:30:34] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** had a

[00:30:34] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** psych

[00:30:34] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** degree in like, what are you gonna do with
psych degree?

[00:30:36] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So

[00:30:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I was like, I figured I'd have to get a
master's at some point, but I didn't want to go to school again.

[00:30:42] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So that's how I became a teacher. I did
some alternative certification courses and I wanted to teach math because my dad
is an engineer and so he like forced me to do math. Like every night, like it
was your typical like sitting at the kitchen table, like your dad's like,

[00:30:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** do this again.

[00:30:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And you're like, ha, [00:31:00] yay my

[00:31:02] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I didn't have that problem.

[00:31:06] **Jason:** Do you

[00:31:06] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Um,

[00:31:07] **Robbie Wagner:** No, I do have a dad

[00:31:08] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** and he's an

[00:31:09] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** engineer, but

[00:31:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** he's not, He didn't force it upon

[00:31:12] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** you. So, yeah, I, uh, I got really good at
math and after college I didn't take a lot of math. 'cause with the psych
degree, I think I only needed to take like one course. But after college I was
like, well, I used to be good at math, so maybe I can teach it.

[00:31:24] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So I did the alternative certification
courses, but I needed like five more math courses. No, sorry, I think maybe like
four.

[00:31:31] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And one of them. And one of one of them
was college algebra, which, you know, like I'm sure some people. We're fine with
it, but it was really awesome because I would get to class early and basically
like tutor my classmates and, , it was just a lot of fun.

[00:31:47] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Math is cool. And also side note, don't
let your children say that they suck at math and don't let them hear you say
that

[00:31:53] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** because it is, it is a self-fulfilling
prophecy and you know, it'll get stuck in their head and then they'll just shut
[00:32:00] down in math class.

[00:32:01] **Jason:** You mentioned, , Cuban dad,

[00:32:02] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah,

[00:32:03] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** my parents are Cuban.

[00:32:04] **Jason:** Yeah, how much

[00:32:05] **Jason:** of

[00:32:06] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** And Catholic. Not traumatizing at all.

[00:32:07] **Jason:** I was gonna say, how much of that Cuban Catholic
upbringing sort of influenced you as far as like your life and stuff?

[00:32:17] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I mean,

[00:32:17] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that, that's

[00:32:17] **Jason:** that's admittedly hard and

[00:32:19] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** you

[00:32:20] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** joke

[00:32:20] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** about it, but

[00:32:21] **Jason:** like,

[00:32:22] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** what's that , there was a lot of guilt. I
don't know. We are really close though, like since I've hit adulthood and
everything, like, you know, we've got our road bumps and everything, but, like

[00:32:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I was what, I

[00:32:34] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** guess the first generation

[00:32:35] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** born in America in my family.

[00:32:36] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So I'm like full-blooded Cuban.

[00:32:38] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** But I get teased cause I have an accent.

[00:32:41] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** you would think so. 'cause I'm what, like
the eldest of my family of, but no, There was always pressure to do well in
school, but like I

[00:32:49] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** was

[00:32:50] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** incredibly spoiled.

[00:32:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Like,

[00:32:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I'm

[00:32:53] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** sad to

[00:32:53] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** say

[00:32:54] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:32:54] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** was

[00:32:54] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** very spoiled. I was very

[00:32:55] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** lucky as a kid. Um,

[00:32:57] **Jason:** you got all

[00:32:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** just, yeah, like my parents

[00:32:59] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** just, what do they [00:33:00] call?

[00:33:00] **Jason:** L Barbie.

[00:33:03] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Oh my God, L Bario. Um,

[00:33:07] **Jason:** Sounds

[00:33:07] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** but like, you know, they wanna give you
what they couldn't have when they were younger.

[00:33:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** , My parents grew up like before Castro,
and then like when he took over, that's whenever like my dad, .

[00:33:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** He tried to escape. ,, him and like a
group

[00:33:19] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** of his

[00:33:19] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** friends

[00:33:20] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** tried

[00:33:20] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** to swim outta Cuba, but like one of

[00:33:22] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** them started,

[00:33:24] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** yeah, they started.

[00:33:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** treading

[00:33:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** water like

[00:33:27] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** right

[00:33:27] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** away.

[00:33:27] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** He's like

[00:33:27] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** too tired. So

[00:33:28] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** they had to like, basically they were

[00:33:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** trying

[00:33:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** to

[00:33:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like

[00:33:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** keep him from drowning basically. And so
they got caught

[00:33:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** and

[00:33:33] **Jason:** Do you, hold on. Do you, do you

[00:33:35] **Jason:** feel

[00:33:35] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like

[00:33:35] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that's

[00:33:36] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** something you

[00:33:36] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** should maybe

[00:33:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** for

[00:33:38] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** maybe

[00:33:38] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like

[00:33:38] **Robbie Wagner:** practice

[00:33:39] **Robbie Wagner:** swimming for a long

[00:33:40] **Robbie Wagner:** time

[00:33:40] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** time or Trained,

[00:33:41] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** how to swim. Yeah.

[00:33:42] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** no, I, you know, desperate times, I guess.

[00:33:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Um,

[00:33:46] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I don't, but uh,

[00:33:49] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:33:49] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** so then they were, they were in political
prison,

[00:33:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** so

[00:33:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** my

[00:33:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** dad

[00:33:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** was

[00:33:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like,

[00:33:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** screw

[00:33:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** it,

[00:33:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I'm

[00:33:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** gonna

[00:33:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** do

[00:33:53] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** this by myself

[00:33:53] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** next time.

[00:33:54] **Jason:** Could you imagine being like thrown in jail? 'cause you
can't swim.

[00:33:58] **Jason:** Like

[00:33:58] **Jason:** your one

[00:33:59] **Jason:** flaw in life [00:34:00] was you didn't

[00:34:00] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:34:00] **Jason:** lessons.

[00:34:01] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:34:01] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** guess

[00:34:02] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** probably

[00:34:02] **Jason:** different back then. Maybe the, they didn't have A-Y-M-C-A
like shark program or

[00:34:06] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** yeah. I don't think they have a YMC in
Cuba. They like barely

[00:34:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** have electricity, so,

[00:34:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** yeah, you, you laugh so you don't cry. But
no. So like, the second time he escaped, like he political prison is different
'cause like he could like visit my mom at her house. 'cause at this time they
were already married. , So like he could go visit her and, you know, whatever.

[00:34:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So he went to like the black market, got
some flippers. , And then he

[00:34:29] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** ended

[00:34:29] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** up like swimming out

[00:34:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that night

[00:34:32] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** and

[00:34:32] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like, I think, I think it was like

[00:34:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** five

[00:34:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** hours

[00:34:34] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** later.

[00:34:35] **Robbie Wagner:** right. this

[00:34:36] **Robbie Wagner:** is

[00:34:36] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** not

[00:34:36] **Jason:** funny, but

[00:34:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** five

[00:34:38] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** hours

[00:34:38] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** later

[00:34:39] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** he was picked up. No.

[00:34:42] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** my dad

[00:34:42] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** could swim.

[00:34:43] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Which is funny because now he, like,

[00:34:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** before

[00:34:46] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** he retired, he, so he worked on like the
platforms and stuff like oil rigs and, , before he retired, like they had to do
swim tests and stuff

[00:34:54] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** in

[00:34:54] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** case like

[00:34:55] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** the

[00:34:55] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** helicopter

[00:34:55] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** fell

[00:34:55] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** into

[00:34:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** the

[00:34:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** ocean

[00:34:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** and stuff. and he,

[00:34:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** they put a red cap

[00:34:58] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** on him

[00:34:59] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** because they

[00:34:59] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** were

[00:34:59] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like, [00:35:00]

[00:35:00] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** you are a risk.

[00:35:00] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** We have to watch

[00:35:01] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** for you.

[00:35:02] **Jason:** I mean,

[00:35:02] **Jason:** you

[00:35:02] **Jason:** say

[00:35:03] **Jason:** he can swim,

[00:35:03] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Florida coastline indicates other?

[00:35:06] **Jason:** but he,

[00:35:06] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** No, but he, so he swam for five hours, ,
and then he got picked up, like it

[00:35:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** was

[00:35:10] **Jason:** Jesus.

[00:35:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** water. There were like

[00:35:12] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** boats

[00:35:13] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** patrolling,

[00:35:13] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** so

[00:35:13] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** he'd have to

[00:35:14] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like swim

[00:35:14] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** underwater

[00:35:15] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** and

[00:35:15] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** then until

[00:35:15] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** he got

[00:35:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** past

[00:35:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** them and like, yeah,

[00:35:17] **Jason:** the waters are infested with the sharks.

[00:35:20] **Jason:** Yeah.

[00:35:21] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Oh yes.

[00:35:22] **Jason:** Wow. Geez.

[00:35:24] **Jason:** yeah,

[00:35:24] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** you

[00:35:25] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** know,

[00:35:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I don't know.

[00:35:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Strong background.

[00:35:28] **Jason:** uh, apparently, I mean,

[00:35:30] **Jason:** I guess we

[00:35:31] **Jason:** will kind

[00:35:31] **Jason:** of pivot away from tech a little

[00:35:33] **Jason:** bit

[00:35:33] **Jason:** as

[00:35:33] **Jason:** far

[00:35:33] **Jason:** as

[00:35:33] **Jason:** this

[00:35:34] **Jason:** one, but

[00:35:34] **Jason:** it's like

[00:35:34] **Jason:** how has that

[00:35:35] **Jason:** influenced how you raise your kids?

[00:35:38] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** because

[00:35:39] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:35:39] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** think

[00:35:39] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** we've all

[00:35:40] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** also had

[00:35:40] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that

[00:35:41] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** swim

[00:35:41] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** lessons or

[00:35:42] **Jason:** Yeah,

[00:35:42] **Robbie Wagner:** are a, a priority.

[00:35:44] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Oh my gosh. With Sebastian's fricking
condition and L cleft and everything. Like

[00:35:48] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** we put

[00:35:49] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** them in

[00:35:49] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** swim

[00:35:49] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** class

[00:35:50] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** and we, but it's

[00:35:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like.

[00:35:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** ,

[00:35:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Make

[00:35:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** sure he

[00:35:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** doesn't

[00:35:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** swallow

[00:35:53] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** too much water

[00:35:54] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** because he'll get pneumonia. Yeah, Well, I

[00:35:56] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** mean, because he has to drink thickened
liquids.

[00:35:58] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah. I

[00:35:59] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** can't [00:36:00] imagine. Yeah. He has to
drink thickened liquids so like we're supposedly we, he had surgery over the
summer, but he keeps being sick, so we can't test to see if the surgery

[00:36:08] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** actually closed up

[00:36:10] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** the cleft or not.

[00:36:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** , But yeah,

[00:36:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** he would still

[00:36:11] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** have to

[00:36:12] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** learn to swallow

[00:36:12] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** thin like normal liquids like you, like we
drink.

[00:36:15] **Jason:** like wine.

[00:36:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** yeah,

[00:36:17] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah. I don't know, I think that like my
dad's like workaholic, perseverance stuff definitely has, stuck around

[00:36:24] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** because obviously

[00:36:25] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like without

[00:36:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that

[00:36:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I wouldn't be able to transition from one
career to another while working a full-time job and raising a family. So,

[00:36:33] **Jason:** as far as the transition goes, like why software engineer

[00:36:36] **Jason:** specifically

[00:36:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I think it's the whole problem solving
aspect of it. , Especially after like the tube feed tracker kind of took off in
that community, , it really provided like the motivation to, be like, okay,
Roxy, you're on the right path. Like people, you're, you know, and so whenever I
like do a cover letter or like interview, I'm like, okay, well I want to do
this, but on a bigger scale, you know, like I want to be able to
impact.[00:37:00]

[00:37:00] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** A greater amount of people, I like problem
solving. It helps you and it helps me feel fulfilled.

[00:37:06] **Jason:** The self-awareness moment. And Robbie, I'm gonna ask you
the same question when she answer after she answers this.

[00:37:12] **Jason:** , Biggest weakness and biggest strength?

[00:37:14] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:37:14] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** feel like

[00:37:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** they

[00:37:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** might be

[00:37:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** the

[00:37:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** same

[00:37:18] **Jason:** which is what?

[00:37:19] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** the

[00:37:20] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like,

[00:37:21] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** don't

[00:37:21] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** stop

[00:37:22] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** until

[00:37:22] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** your body falls

[00:37:22] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** apart.

[00:37:23] **Jason:** Don't stop until you get enough. Or

[00:37:25] **Jason:** don't stop,

[00:37:26] **Jason:** believing.

[00:37:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:37:26] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** know. Yeah. I think it's like

[00:37:29] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I keep going

[00:37:30] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** until,

[00:37:32] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like

[00:37:32] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** my eyes explode at CYCA couple weeks ago.
I freaking never had allergies that bad. And I think it was only compounded by
like, the stress of like leaving home, going to a conference, interviewing while
I'm at the conference.

[00:37:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Just like

[00:37:46] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** nonstop till your

[00:37:46] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** body like

[00:37:47] **Jason:** what's the

[00:37:48] **Jason:** goal of that

[00:37:49] **Jason:** that you feel like you have to keep pushing?

[00:37:51] **Jason:** So, okay.

[00:37:52] **Jason:** No, I mean,

[00:37:52] **Jason:** that,

[00:37:53] **Jason:** that's, that's,

[00:37:53] **Jason:** what

[00:37:53] **Jason:** it is. But I mean, what's the

[00:37:55] **Jason:** job?

[00:37:55] **Jason:** Do I think.

[00:37:56] **Jason:** that's

[00:37:56] **Jason:** the bigger picture. It's, It's, the why

[00:37:59] **Jason:** the

[00:37:59] **Jason:** job

[00:37:59] **Jason:** [00:38:00] facilitates things for you. it's

[00:38:01] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** It's not the,

[00:38:01] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** job, it's

[00:38:02] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** the

[00:38:02] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** job

[00:38:03] **Jason:** can provide for.

[00:38:05] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So I like through this whole

[00:38:07] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** journey

[00:38:07] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** with a hundred Debs and Leon and
everything like. , The community has helped me sort of realize that I am leaning
more towards like, DeVere and community and, , so I feel like the fact that,
like I already said, that I end up being a resource,

[00:38:20] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I don't

[00:38:20] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** know,

[00:38:21] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** really kind of

[00:38:22] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** paves the

[00:38:22] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** way towards

[00:38:23] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** one of, a role in one of those
environments.

[00:38:25] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** So, ,

[00:38:26] **Jason:** I think it makes sense.

[00:38:27] **Jason:** I

[00:38:27] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** mean,

[00:38:27] **Jason:** you

[00:38:27] **Jason:** have

[00:38:28] **Jason:** the

[00:38:28] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** education

[00:38:28] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** background.

[00:38:29] **Jason:** I mean,

[00:38:29] **Jason:** I

[00:38:29] **Jason:** feel

[00:38:29] **Jason:** like

[00:38:29] **Jason:** there's

[00:38:30] **Jason:** a

[00:38:30] **Jason:** lot

[00:38:30] **Jason:** of transferrable skills there, so

[00:38:32] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that's

[00:38:33] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** fair,

[00:38:33] **Jason:** Robbie. All right. Biggest strength, biggest weakness.

[00:38:35] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** No. Fair. He had more time to prep

[00:38:37] **Robbie Wagner:** I don't know. My brain

[00:38:38] **Robbie Wagner:** doesn't work.

[00:38:38] **Robbie Wagner:** That's my weakness.

[00:38:40] **Robbie Wagner:** Um, yeah, no, I think, my weakness is like not
spending enough time like reacting too quickly to some

[00:38:49] **Robbie Wagner:** things.

[00:38:49] **Robbie Wagner:** With parenting

[00:38:50] **Robbie Wagner:** or like dealing with people who aren't doing what
I want at work or whatever, like not being diplomatic enough to like take a
breath and like, say the right thing

[00:38:59] **Robbie Wagner:** [00:39:00] necessarily. strength,

[00:39:01] **Robbie Wagner:** uh, I don't know. I like to work a lot, so,

[00:39:05] **Robbie Wagner:** uh, like I

[00:39:06] **Robbie Wagner:** code

[00:39:06] **Robbie Wagner:** for fun after I code, so

[00:39:08] **Robbie Wagner:** guess that's a

[00:39:08] **Robbie Wagner:** strength,

[00:39:09] **Robbie Wagner:** a

[00:39:09] **Robbie Wagner:** lot

[00:39:09] **Robbie Wagner:** of

[00:39:09] **Robbie Wagner:** output.

[00:39:10] **Jason:** I feel

[00:39:10] **Jason:** like a

[00:39:10] **Jason:** lot

[00:39:11] **Jason:** of people do that. I've noticed a

[00:39:12] **Jason:** lot of

[00:39:12] **Jason:** developers

[00:39:13] **Jason:** hobby is developing.

[00:39:14] **Robbie Wagner:** Yep.

[00:39:15] **Robbie Wagner:** it

[00:39:15] **Robbie Wagner:** is. Yeah.

[00:39:16] **Robbie Wagner:** I mean, before kids it was easy. 'cause like my
wife's like, I'm gonna watch this, whatever. And I'm like, I'm gonna code for

[00:39:23] **Robbie Wagner:** five hours. yeah, now it's, it's harder 'cause I'm
like,

[00:39:26] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:39:26] **Robbie Wagner:** have

[00:39:26] **Robbie Wagner:** one hour

[00:39:27] **Robbie Wagner:** of free time.

[00:39:27] **Robbie Wagner:** So I'm watching Law and Order SVU in this

[00:39:29] **Robbie Wagner:** bitch.

[00:39:29] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm

[00:39:29] **Robbie Wagner:** not

[00:39:29] **Robbie Wagner:** like,

[00:39:30] **Jason:** Yeah, baby

[00:39:32] **Jason:** Maloney, old

[00:39:33] **Jason:** blue

[00:39:33] **Jason:** eyes.

[00:39:34] **Robbie Wagner:** no, he's in a different law

[00:39:35] **Robbie Wagner:** and order now,

[00:39:36] **Robbie Wagner:** but he's on a, , what is his?

[00:39:38] **Robbie Wagner:** Called, I should know this, but I

[00:39:39] **Robbie Wagner:** don't. I'm

[00:39:40] **Robbie Wagner:** embarrassed.

[00:39:41] **Jason:** I, feel like you really dropped the ball there. Boom.
Boom.

[00:39:44] **Jason:** Whichever one.

[00:39:44] **Robbie Wagner:** Whichever

[00:39:44] **Robbie Wagner:** one.

[00:39:45] **Robbie Wagner:** he's on now. It'll come to me at some point, but
it's on. Oh, peacock only. Like you can't watch on NBC anymore and I don't, I
don't pay for

[00:39:51] **Robbie Wagner:** Peacock, so,

[00:39:52] **Jason:** Elliot Stabler.

[00:39:53] **Jason:** We need

[00:39:53] **Jason:** him back

[00:39:54] **Jason:** on

[00:39:54] **Jason:** prime time. Fuck that premium stuff.

[00:39:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:39:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** watch

[00:39:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Below Deck

[00:40:03] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like

[00:40:03] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** it's

[00:40:03] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** complete

[00:40:04] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** garbage, but

[00:40:04] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** it's

[00:40:04] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** not

[00:40:05] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** as

[00:40:05] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** bad. That's

[00:40:06] **Robbie Wagner:** It's a guilty pleasure. Yeah.

[00:40:08] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** not as

[00:40:08] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** bad as like the house wise.

[00:40:15] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** it,

[00:40:15] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** but I like below deck cause

[00:40:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** it's

[00:40:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like

[00:40:17] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** you

[00:40:17] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** see

[00:40:17] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like

[00:40:18] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** lives

[00:40:19] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** and

[00:40:19] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** then you're following the yacht crew
that's like serving them, like while they're on the

[00:40:23] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** boat.

[00:40:23] **Jason:** like there's a

[00:40:23] **Jason:** height joke there somewhere that I

[00:40:25] **Jason:** just cannot

[00:40:26] **Jason:** get

[00:40:37] **Jason:** for,

[00:40:37] **Jason:** this

[00:40:38] **Jason:** IRL

[00:40:39] **Jason:** Cabernet

[00:40:39] **Jason:** commute. I

[00:40:40] **Jason:** feel

[00:40:41] **Jason:** like we

[00:40:41] **Jason:** should

[00:40:41] **Jason:** do these more. This is pretty

[00:40:42] **Jason:** cool.

[00:40:43] **Jason:** What's

[00:40:44] **Jason:** success look like to you?

[00:40:46] **Jason:** the last

[00:40:46] **Jason:** question, the final boss?

[00:40:52] **Jason:** No,

[00:40:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** but really like,

[00:40:53] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like snagging, you know, my first role in

a while to like learn and like, you know, ramp up and onboard and, you know,

[00:41:35] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** dream

[00:41:35] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Uh, I

[00:41:36] **Robbie Wagner:** I have

[00:41:36] **Jason:** I

[00:41:36] **Jason:** have

[00:41:36] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** my gym

[00:41:36] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** clothes

[00:41:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** set

[00:41:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** out.

[00:41:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:41:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** don't

[00:41:37] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** have to

[00:41:38] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like do hair and

[00:41:38] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** makeup or anything.

[00:41:40] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Yeah, I used to look,

[00:41:41] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** That is when I first

[00:41:42] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** started

[00:41:43] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** going to the gym at five in the morning.

[00:41:44] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I would sleep

[00:41:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** in my

[00:41:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** gym

[00:41:45] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** clothes

[00:41:46] **Robbie Wagner:** slowly.

[00:41:47] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:41:47] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** would

[00:41:47] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** wake up early

[00:41:48] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** enough to where I

[00:41:49] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** wouldn't

[00:41:49] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** have to sleep in

[00:41:50] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** my gym clothes.

[00:41:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** But

[00:41:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** that

[00:41:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** is

[00:41:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** how

[00:41:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:41:51] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** did

[00:41:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** it. That's

[00:41:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** how

[00:41:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:41:52] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** started

[00:41:53] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. I'm way

[00:41:53] **Robbie Wagner:** too

[00:41:54] **Robbie Wagner:** sleepy

[00:41:54] **Robbie Wagner:** in the mornings I wake up, I'm like.

[00:41:56] **Robbie Wagner:** At night, I'm like, you

[00:41:57] **Robbie Wagner:** know

[00:41:57] **Robbie Wagner:** what?

[00:41:57] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I'm gonna work out at 6:00 AM I'm
definitely gonna [00:42:00] wake up.

[00:42:05] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like, normally,

[00:42:06] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** like,

[00:42:06] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:42:06] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** used

[00:42:06] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** to

[00:42:06] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** go to the gym at 5:00

[00:42:07] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** PM and I

[00:42:08] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** think

[00:42:08] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** my

[00:42:08] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** hi, my tallest box jump was like 30 or 32
inches,

[00:42:12] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** which is almost half my

[00:42:13] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** height, by the way.

[00:42:14] **Jason:** tall as you, but

[00:42:15] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** way I

[00:42:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** would ever

[00:42:16] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** try that at five in the morning.

[00:42:17] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** Like

[00:42:17] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** I

[00:42:17] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** would

[00:42:18] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** just

[00:42:18] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** die

[00:42:19] **Jason:** I've

[00:42:19] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** death by box,

[00:42:21] **Jason:** in the morning.

[00:42:21] **Jason:** So it's just, I, I can get

[00:42:23] **Jason:** up early, I can do work,

[00:42:25] **Jason:** but

[00:42:25] **Jason:** I

[00:42:25] **Jason:** couldn't

[00:42:25] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** work

[00:42:25] **Roxy Rodriguez-Becker:** out.

[00:42:26] **Jason:** And I'm a runner
