[00:00:00] **Intro:** Welcome to Syntax. Welcome to a brand new episode of the
Front End Happy Hour podcast. Welcome to this week's JS Party. Live from Ship
Shape Studios, this is Whiskey Web and Whatnot. With your hosts, Robbie the
Wagner, and me, Charles William Carpenter III. That's right Charles. We drink
whiskey and talk about web development.

[00:00:27] **Intro:** I mean, it's all in the name. It's not that deep. This is
Whiskey Web and Whatnot. Do not adjust your set.

[00:00:36] **Robbie Wagner:** Hey, what's up everybody? Welcome to Tequila Tech
and tangents a special edition of Whiskey Web and whatnot with your sometimes
hosts, you're probably confused these days, but it's RobbieTheWagner, and
Charles, William Carpenter the third.

[00:00:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, you're always here. We always have to see
your dumb face, but

[00:00:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** here

[00:00:55] **Robbie Wagner:** not always. When you did, uh, lots of live ones.
You did them without me,

[00:00:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. [00:01:00] That's true. Fair enough.

[00:01:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** Anyway, let's move on to the guest. It's not
about you,

[00:01:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** man.

[00:01:04] **Robbie Wagner:** I know.

[00:01:05] **Ali Diamond:** Hi everyone. I'm Allie. You could find me online
everywhere at to ending with Allie on everything including Minecraft.

[00:01:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yes. I have to test that. My son is very in the
Minecraft and so, , yeah, we'll have to find you

[00:01:17] **Chuck Carpenter:** there.

[00:01:18] **Robbie Wagner:** Is Minecraft a programming language? That's our
first question.

[00:01:21] **Ali Diamond:** uh, no. They use, it's Java and Lua. I think they
use Lua now for Moding,

[00:01:27] **Ali Diamond:** but

[00:01:27] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I know. It's just a joke.

[00:01:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** Hmm.

[00:01:30] **Ali Diamond:** I take it very seriously. I haven't played Minecraft
in a while, but it is a great game. And it's also like, I love saying like and
Minecraft because it's like, because I can get my name everywhere.

[00:01:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:01:41] **Ali Diamond:** No one expects it.

[00:01:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, that's true. I had never even thought
about that. There's no way I could get my name on Minecraft at this point. It's
like

[00:01:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** that

[00:01:49] **Robbie Wagner:** You could get Charles, William Carpenter the
third.

[00:01:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** possibly. You think? Because I'm not sure. I'm
not,

[00:01:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** I'm

[00:01:54] **Robbie Wagner:** You think there's another one? There probably is
another one. Somewhere

[00:01:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. So there's also that. [00:02:00] Yeah, I
do, , the number three. So it's Charles WTHE three RD.

[00:02:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** That's the way I've been able to like work
around it a little bit lately. I used to have just Chuck Carpenter everywhere,
and then I rage quit things like 10 years ago. And then when you came back to
some of those things, it turns out I lost 'em all. So , don't make that mistake
is what I would

[00:02:21] **Ali Diamond:** why I lost my telegram,

[00:02:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** Uh, yeah.

[00:02:24] **Ali Diamond:** so

[00:02:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Fair

[00:02:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** enough. No. Yeah. I won't find, I won't look for
you there.

[00:02:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** Just on signal. , Yeah, I don't know

[00:02:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** on anything.

[00:02:33] **Ali Diamond:** me only on Twitter and Instagram,

[00:02:36] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yes, that's reasonable. We'll go with that.

[00:02:39] **Chuck Carpenter:** Alright. , Let's,

[00:02:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** I

[00:02:41] **Robbie Wagner:** What are we drinking,

[00:02:42] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, let's start with the booze. Okay. So I
know I'm gonna say this long, the wrong esp

[00:02:47] **Robbie Wagner:** and Long

[00:02:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** tequila Blanco, uh, it is made up with c , 100%
Piot, agave, , it just says [00:03:00] pure O on my bottle 'cause I bought it in
Italy, I think. , So it's a hundred percent agave, double distilled, 40 proof,
and 80% alcohol. Yeah. I love the pop. Uh, yeah. Yeah.

[00:03:11] **Ali Diamond:** Okay, don't spill. Don't spill. Don't spill.

[00:03:13] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. It's all fun and games till you spill on
your desk.

[00:03:17] **Ali Diamond:** Ugh. I have three cup holders on this desk. Just so
I'll never spill.

[00:03:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** That's excellent.

[00:03:25] **Ali Diamond:** Okay. Also, I'm just gonna let the audience know I
am making a mixed drink

[00:03:29] **Ali Diamond:** because

[00:03:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** you're not even gonna try it straight first.

[00:03:32] **Ali Diamond:** I'll take a shot.

[00:03:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. Do it.

[00:03:35] **Ali Diamond:** Okay.

[00:03:36] **Chuck Carpenter:** do that. Yeah, we'll do that. ,

[00:03:37] **Robbie Wagner:** I maybe poured too much for that,

[00:03:38] **Ali Diamond:** no, I'll just do it from the bottle. Okay.

[00:03:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** oh, fair enough.

[00:03:42] **Ali Diamond:** It's so tiny. Cheers.

[00:03:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** Ste. Uh, not bad. Yeah, it's definitely very,

[00:03:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** very

[00:03:51] **Robbie Wagner:** I braced myself for that to be very bad, and it
was not that

[00:03:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** No, it's not. It's like, it's kind of refreshing
and definitely has a limes [00:04:00] to it. I don't know. We usually, I know
that you listen, uh, and watch our show all the time. Nice. Is that

[00:04:08] **Ali Diamond:** I love you so much.

[00:04:09] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Is that grapefruit or is that something
else?

[00:04:11] **Ali Diamond:** This is their new flavor, cranberry punch.

[00:04:14] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. All right. Worth trying. I'm a big fan of
the Paloma cocktail though,

[00:04:18] **Robbie Wagner:** They have alcoholic spin drift now too,

[00:04:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah, we, I don't have Costco or
Spin Drift or anything else probably,

[00:04:26] **Chuck Carpenter:** but,

[00:04:27] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:04:28] **Robbie Wagner:** but you have wine for like one euro,

[00:04:31] **Chuck Carpenter:** it's so cheap, the wine here, so this is an
amazing thing. Yeah. So usually we pretend like we know about alcohol and we'll
smell it and, you know, say words and give it a taste and we give it a rating.

[00:04:42] **Chuck Carpenter:** You probably already know this as an avid fan of
the show. of course yes. So Robbie will tell you what our rating system is.

[00:04:51] **Robbie Wagner:** not even gonna talk about how it smells or tastes
or anything.

[00:04:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** You do you wanna jump right into

[00:04:55] **Ali Diamond:** we could do

[00:04:55] **Robbie Wagner:** No, I had some jokes prepared. Like, oh, it smells
like, you know, when everyone's at [00:05:00] the bar and someone makes a bad
decision and we should all have tequila shots or like, I don't know. Anyway,

[00:05:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well, no,

[00:05:06] **Ali Diamond:** I, should I just apologize to the audience first
because they asked, they're like, what whiskey do you like? And I'm like, I
don't, I don't like whiskey. , So I just feel like I wouldn't do whiskey, the
whiskey aficionados justice by sitting here and cringing every time I had to
take a sip. And I was like, what about tequila?

[00:05:27] **Ali Diamond:** And they were like, absolutely. so

[00:05:31] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well,

[00:05:31] **Chuck Carpenter:** it's a

[00:05:32] **Robbie Wagner:** We're accommodating.

[00:05:33] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. We want you to have a good time. you
wouldn't enjoy that and you probably wouldn't drink very much of it. And taking
the wheels off is half the fun. And then the second thing is it gives us an
opportunity to come up with like clever little, like we've done rum react and
ramblings, and now we have, yeah.

[00:05:49] **Chuck Carpenter:** So we did a wine one maybe one time, I

[00:05:51] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Yeah.

[00:05:52] **Robbie Wagner:** Just wine, web and whatnot from, uh, all things
open. Catch us doing that again in October.

[00:05:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. , US meaning Robbie? I [00:06:00] cannot
fly back quite yet.

[00:06:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** but I'm gonna

[00:06:03] **Robbie Wagner:** they would allow you, but your family would
probably be upset.

[00:06:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Yeah.

[00:06:06] **Ali Diamond:** really far.

[00:06:09] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:06:09] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. To Raleigh. I'm gonna go to New York at
some point

[00:06:13] **Ali Diamond:** Oh my God. When you're here, let me know.

[00:06:15] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. We'll do, yeah, my companies. Okay. Uh,
yeah.

[00:06:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. Do they, do they open at like 5:00 PM for
early bird specials, stuff like that? You know, I'm old,

[00:06:27] **Ali Diamond:** you know they open at like noon?

[00:06:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah. Okay. Well,

[00:06:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** that's

[00:06:30] **Ali Diamond:** need a 5:00 PM bar. The happy hour starts at 5:00 PM
The bars are all rolling by five.

[00:06:35] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. Fair enough. I'm open, , yeah, my
company's CEO is based there and we do like, , meet in persons twice a year, and
New York is the next one, so,

[00:06:45] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah. Very nice. Yeah. Don't you, you live
there, right? Yes.

[00:06:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** So that's good. If you hated it, that would be
problematic. All right. So. I would ask you to, uh, sniff and get notes, but
[00:07:00] it would be cranberry, I think. Wait, I can wait. Hold on. I keep
like making the worst faces trying to open this.

[00:07:06] **Ali Diamond:** oh my god, my, my nose. Isn't this like, good for
this? , I would say that comparative to most liquors that you smell, it doesn't
punch as spirit forward in a way that would like burn the back of your throat
when you smell it. It's very gentle.

[00:07:23] **Ali Diamond:** I'm gonna say the word grassy, that's what comes to
my mind.

[00:07:26] **Ali Diamond:** But, I know that somewhere in the comments someone's
gonna be like, it's never had an aggressing note in its life. She doesn't know
what she's talking about. No, I don't. I

[00:07:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. None of us do. it's

[00:07:35] **Chuck Carpenter:** all

[00:07:35] **Chuck Carpenter:** it's

[00:07:35] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Agave is just a big grass, right?

[00:07:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, it is. It does have like very, like, you
know when you get sunburned and then like you have to get that green gel stuff
that has aloe in it. Yes. But specific to the green gel, not just go smell an
aloe plant, which I know you can break

[00:07:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** them

[00:07:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** and

[00:07:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** kind of get the

[00:07:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** same. Yeah. I don't know, but it smells

[00:07:56] **Robbie Wagner:** does kind of, now that you mention it.

[00:07:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** I know I have the power of [00:08:00]
suggestion,

[00:08:00] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. It also smells like a Big Mac to me.

[00:08:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** you

[00:08:05] **Robbie Wagner:** No,

[00:08:07] **Ali Diamond:** Quiet.

[00:08:08] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm just, I'm just kidding. I was seeing if I
could make you smell that, but No, probably

[00:08:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. The power of suggestion does sometimes
work. It's What about like dried apricots?

[00:08:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** Do you

[00:08:18] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, so much of that. No, actually none of that.
This time. None of that? Yeah.

[00:08:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, I just get that like allo gel and then the
taste is very smooth. Tequila. It is

[00:08:28] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:08:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** you know, it is only 40 proof, sorry, 40%
alcohol, 80 proof.

[00:08:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** I've got it, uh, backwards there. 'cause it
would get real weird if it was 160 proof.

[00:08:41] **Ali Diamond:** The thing I like about tequila versus like a vodka
and like the, the, the darker browner liquors, like we could talk about, that's
a whole different experience for me. But like, compared to vodka, like this to
me has a, a nicer flavor, but also it's easier for you to get tequila [00:09:00]
that won't hurt on the way down versus like a vodka that won't be as aggressive
or as harsh.

[00:09:06] **Ali Diamond:** But it's still, you can still have really great
drinks with tequila.

[00:09:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah. Because you can still feel like you're
drinking alcohol. What I don't like about like really high quality vodka is
basically, the better the vodka is, the more it kind of fades away and then
becomes nothing. So you're just tasting the mixer. It's like, I want this thing
to get me drunk. Great. Good for you.

[00:09:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** But I want to like experience a different
flavor, so I would agree with that. I do typically like an anejo though, so I
want a little bit of age, a little bit of brown in there. , Just to kind of, you
know, diversify a little.

[00:09:41] **Ali Diamond:** I don't know the difference.

[00:09:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah.

[00:09:44] **Ali Diamond:** sorry.

[00:09:46] **Chuck Carpenter:** No,

[00:09:46] **Robbie Wagner:** No, no, it's fine.

[00:09:47] **Robbie Wagner:** I know nothing about tequila. This one, , is not
too bad.

[00:09:51] **Robbie Wagner:** Let's go into the rating system. So we have zero.

[00:09:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** Let's do

[00:09:53] **Ali Diamond:** yeah. Tell me.

[00:09:54] **Robbie Wagner:** Zero to eight tentacles. Zero being the worst. You
never wanna drink it. Wouldn't clean your toilet with [00:10:00] it. Eight. This
is all I want. Clear the shelves. Buy it all the time. Four. Middle of the road.

[00:10:05] **Robbie Wagner:** , Yeah. Kind of pretty

[00:10:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** And, and that's it.

[00:10:08] **Robbie Wagner:** Chuck will go first.

[00:10:09] **Chuck Carpenter:** I will go first. So

[00:10:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** we have drinking problems. Me in particular. ,
So I try to categorize things like I rate it. So I would be rating this against
other tequilas, and then it gets even worse because I've had enough tequilas
that I will rate this against other lanco tequilas. And, , and I actually, like,
I'm surprised, I actually quite enjoy this. , I think it's like we took those
shots and there was no grimace face whatsoever. I think it's a pleasant, clean
taste without being overbearing. There's a small baron, but nothing crazy. So
like, and the price point, at least for me, was pretty incredible.

[00:10:47] **Chuck Carpenter:** This was the most expensive tequila they had at
the grocery

[00:10:51] **Ali Diamond:** Oh, no,

[00:10:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** as a luga, which was 20 euros. Yeah. Out of my
choices, this was the best.

[00:10:58] **Ali Diamond:** I paid 20 bucks.

[00:10:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** [00:11:00] Yeah. But you got half as much.

[00:11:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** Ooh.

[00:11:03] **Robbie Wagner:** I don't know how much mine was 'cause my wife
bought it for me.

[00:11:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah. You have no idea. She just, I mean, yeah.
Uh, so. All of those things actually like really shine for me. I actually take
price into account because if you're selling me something for $60, that is
gross, that's problematic.

[00:11:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** If things are even like worse than that, and
then it's like, what are you doing? Or it's just not good enough, you, you
charge me a hundred dollars and this $30 thing is just as good. So I really like
this. I'm gonna give this out of an eight like wood grab. Again, easily. Would
love to try this in a Paloma, I'm gonna say six and a half.

[00:11:39] **Robbie Wagner:** Nice.

[00:11:40] **Chuck Carpenter:** Ally, do you feel prepared to enter our complex
rating system now that you know that like halves or random numbers are available
to you as well?

[00:11:51] **Ali Diamond:** What if I just like really threw like a, a twist out
there.

[00:11:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** I'm, I'm

[00:11:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** into

[00:11:56] **Robbie Wagner:** Go for it.

[00:11:56] **Ali Diamond:** So I've had nicer [00:12:00] tequilas in the past
for the net gala, which is an event that I throw, I always buy myself a handle
of like a very high quality tequila. Last year was 1942. This year was ca both
of those were both spectacular tequilas that I really enjoyed.

[00:12:14] **Ali Diamond:** Drinking, could take shots at those very easily,
went down very easily. Didn't burn too much, but honestly like looking at the
price versus like quality wise, I've also agreed like I'm putting this somewhere
in a six just because it is that amazing. It is that good. It's like, you know,
not the highest quality, but it doesn't like make me miserable drinking.

[00:12:36] **Ali Diamond:** It still has a very good flavor. So I'm gonna throw
a Tao out there just to be different.

[00:12:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay.

[00:12:42] **Ali Diamond:** pie.

[00:12:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look at you.

[00:12:45] **Ali Diamond:** I said I'm gonna be weird about it.

[00:12:47] **Chuck Carpenter:** no, no, that's okay. Like this is a show for,
you know, nerdy techies, right? We're all in that space, so I think that's,
that's a good way to go. That's clever.

[00:12:58] **Ali Diamond:** Thank you.

[00:12:59] **Robbie Wagner:** I have to [00:13:00] say this is one of the better
tequilas I've had. Maybe I haven't had good ones, I don't know. But like anytime
someone has forced me to drink tequila before at a bar or something, I'm always
hating it. And I don't hate this, like I like drinking this. Okay. So I think
I'm kind of in the same range of like, I don't know what the best would be, but
I six and a half seems appropriate.

[00:13:19] **Ali Diamond:** Oh

[00:13:19] **Ali Diamond:** my God, we're so synced up. We're so aligned.

[00:13:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, I think we need to like take Robbie on the
tequila adventure at some point in the future. That's what it sounds

[00:13:28] **Robbie Wagner:** Sure.

[00:13:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** like, yeah, because other spirits are actually
really good. Robbie, I don't know if you know this, he's just always, I just
drink whiskey 'cause it's easy. Or he drinks,

[00:13:38] **Robbie Wagner:** No, I don't drink whiskey actually. You drink
whiskey? I drink whiskey for the show and then I drink wine, or mostly wine, I
guess. I don't like

[00:13:46] **Chuck Carpenter:** Uh, alcoholic Fresca, you drink

[00:13:49] **Robbie Wagner:** Alcoholic Fresca is good.

[00:13:51] **Ali Diamond:** makes alcoholic drinks.

[00:13:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yes, they

[00:13:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** do. And

[00:13:54] **Ali Diamond:** Oh my God. Spindrift just cut down there. Sorry. I,
I follow Spindrift [00:14:00] very, they just dropped their alcoholic line and
I'm pretty sad about it,

[00:14:03] **Ali Diamond:** so

[00:14:04] **Ali Diamond:** I'll need a fine replacement.

[00:14:05] **Robbie Wagner:** Hmm.

[00:14:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** Fresca is worth exploring. Like Fresca feels
like such a undervalued brand. Like I, I loved Fresca in high school. It was
like really into it, kind of like, I don't know what, what happened. They still
kept making it. I stopped drinking it, I don't know. And then, I don't know, a
couple years ago, like saw it in the store, started jumping back on like, this
is amazing and it tastes good.

[00:14:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** It's zero calories. Like this is a, people are
all over Laqua. . Fresca is where it's at. It's good. And then Robbie introduced
me to the alcoholic version and it's amazing.

[00:14:41] **Ali Diamond:** Can you get it where you're at? The alcoholic
version?

[00:14:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** probably not well,

[00:14:46] **Robbie Wagner:** Seems like something they would not have in Italy,
but I don't

[00:14:49] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well, I haven't seen Fresca at all here yet,
but, never say never, but I take back that I haven't seen like regular drinks,
but alcohol [00:15:00] versions of it.

[00:15:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** So there, there's a little bit of that. There's
a lot less. I was actually pretty pleasantly surprised 'cause there's no Diet
Coke here and there's no like diet sodas whatsoever. You

[00:15:12] **Robbie Wagner:** because they can't do

[00:15:13] **Chuck Carpenter:** get Sprite. Yeah, yeah. That's all like banned.
So it's like,

[00:15:17] **Chuck Carpenter:** ooh,

[00:15:18] **Robbie Wagner:** as it should be.

[00:15:19] **Ali Diamond:** It's been ages since I've been to Italy.

[00:15:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh well, , they still eat a lot of pizza.

[00:15:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** I mean, I eat pizza and gelato multiple times
per week when I'm here and usually lose weight, which is pretty amazing. So I'm,
I'm all about that food quality. Great. so they don't have those things, but I
did find Monster recently, and I'm sure there's a slightly different
formulation, but, you know, sometimes when it's been a, you know, didn't sleep
well, rough night, long drive, I don't know, something like that.

[00:15:49] **Chuck Carpenter:** I grab a monster and they do have that,

[00:15:51] **Ali Diamond:** I've been on like a Celsius Alani new kick here.

[00:15:55] **Ali Diamond:** Really Yurba mate. I love a

[00:15:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, mate is amazing.

[00:15:59] **Ali Diamond:** [00:16:00] love a good yrb.

[00:16:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** in Argentina they say JBA mate. Jba mate. Yeah.
I don't know, I don't care if , how people pronounce it, but it is kind of a
funny thing.

[00:16:10] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah.

[00:16:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** Alright, so now we move to the part of the show
called Hot Takes. we ask you some. I don't know. It, it's usually stuff people
argue about, , on Twitter about, so,

[00:16:23] **Ali Diamond:** like I'm the worst at this because I don't wanna say
I'm the least argumentative person on Twitter, but I just like, don't really
post my hot takes that often. slash I don't feel like I try to go after hot
takes. People ask me like what my edgiest take is in tech and things like that.

[00:16:39] **Ali Diamond:** , Generally they're very gentle. I, my hot takes are
very gentle. Like one of my hot takes is like, if you're A junior engineer or
like a mid-level engineer, it doesn't matter what language that you're writing,
as long as you're learning whatever language you need to get the job done.
What's more important is like understanding, , the paradigms and patterns of
[00:17:00] coding more than anything else, so that then you can jump into
whatever work needs to be done.

[00:17:04] **Ali Diamond:** And that allows you more breadth of opportunities
unless like you are someone who's going into like hardware or like compiler
optimization, where you need to understand the, like, deep fundamentals of
assembly to make sure that your compiler runs fast enough. Like if you're just
doing regular backend of engineering, frontend engineering, it doesn't matter
the language, it doesn't matter the library as long as you're getting the job
done.

[00:17:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** I would say that that in itself is a bit of a
hot take

[00:17:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** and

[00:17:35] **Chuck Carpenter:** is why Yeah. Is that it is too pragmatic and
that you would not fit in to San Francisco.

[00:17:43] **Ali Diamond:** Well, I don't, I lived in San Francisco. I did it, I
did San Francisco pre COVID.

[00:17:48] **Ali Diamond:** And I lived in a hacker house. I've done, I, my lore
is dense and complex. There's many things that I don't

[00:17:53] **Ali Diamond:** talk about. but I, like I did the hacker house in
San Francisco.

[00:17:58] **Ali Diamond:** I've lived with startup founders. I've [00:18:00]
like technically been a startup founder myself. Like I've tried it all. I just
think that there, there is like such single-mindedness in San Francisco and
someone recently put on Twitter, they're like, what would make San Francisco
more tolerable?

[00:18:13] **Ali Diamond:** And I'm like looking down less onto people who are
not in tech.

[00:18:17] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Or looking down less into people who don't
live there. Like what? You don't have to be there

[00:18:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** to provide the Yeah. I mean, they definitely
think so. They definitely think so. There's a lot of that. And then you
definitely have to participate into the circle jerk of libraries that all help
each other become actual web frameworks rather than, I don't know, just use
Django or Rails or something if you're trying to do that.

[00:18:42] **Robbie Wagner:** No, you can't do that.

[00:18:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** You cannot do that. No, it is not cool anymore.
anyway, hot takes, I think that is a little bit of a hot take, but I also fully
embrace that same opinion, so I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Do
you wanna pick one, Robbie, or,

[00:18:57] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah, I'm gonna start in the middle Mac [00:19:00]
Os, or Linux,

[00:19:01] **Ali Diamond:** Oh, I have both. My daily

[00:19:03] **Robbie Wagner:** but which would you pick?

[00:19:05] **Ali Diamond:** Oh, I'm gonna have to pick a Mac and I can very
easily justify it.

[00:19:09] **Ali Diamond:** technically in some nebulous way, the cybersecurity
community has taken me under their wing. Um, and I'm very grateful. I love the
cybersecurity community.

[00:19:19] **Ali Diamond:** If you wanna talk smart shit with smart people, just
find anybody who works in cybersecurity and ask them what they focus on. And you
will have like a five hour conversation of just the most esoteric, fascinating
things about the internet and about technology. And it's amazing. You could
easily nerd snipe anybody who works in cybersecurity.

[00:19:39] **Ali Diamond:** So they're all Linux pilled. And if I were to say
Linux, they're all very mad at me. Even when I'm on my cybersecurity news show,
they're all like, what do you mean you use mag? Like, oh my God, like you're so
locked into the ecosystem. And I'm like, at the end of the day, I'm not someone
who cares a lot about deep customization of [00:20:00] my workspaces.

[00:20:01] **Ali Diamond:** I don't really, I don't have a lot of external
tools. I'm not like, , hyper, like I don't need my keyboard to sit some certain
way. I don't need this to show up in the corner there. I don't need to be
manipulating my bios when my computer loads up. Like that's just not me. That's
never been me. Even when I was like an Android user and I've had like the
ability to deeply customize my phone, it just like wasn't something I was very
interested in.

[00:20:27] **Ali Diamond:** , I don't even know what my iPhone background is.
Like I change it once a year. I just really don't care about the customization
of it, all that, deep ability to dive into the system in a way that many Linux
users deeply appreciate. So something like Mac Os where , I still have a little
bit of update trauma from a child and I could talk about this.

[00:20:44] **Ali Diamond:** It's very interesting. but I just like don't wanna
have to think about like a lot of the issues that Linux puts on you as a user
versus a lot of the issues that Mac takes away from you as a user.

[00:20:56] **Robbie Wagner:** It sounds like you like getting work done, which a
lot of people don't. [00:21:00] They like to configure things for a long time.

[00:21:03] **Ali Diamond:** yeah. I mean like why spend a hundred hours
configuring your phone, configuring your desktop,

[00:21:09] **Ali Diamond:** and this is my other hot take. I don't care what
like text editor you're using, as long as you're getting your work done, don't
shame people for the way that they choose to use their technology.

[00:21:19] **Ali Diamond:** Because as a reminder, people, everybody is
different. The way they learn, the way they process, the way that they work best
is different. And you need to create equitable and kind spaces to allow people
to find and function, , in their most optimized way. So being like, Ugh, you're
not using Vim. Who cares?

[00:21:39] **Ali Diamond:** Who cares? I'm using code. I'm still doing the same
work as you.

[00:21:45] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, the output is kind of the same. And really
at the end of the day, the output to whatever consumer of your thing, they don't
know any of that stuff and they do not give a shit.

[00:21:56] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah. Um.

[00:21:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** , There is that aspect too. So, but if you like
[00:22:00] that, great. Go for you. I just am, I'm kind of in the same coat, you
know, camp too.

[00:22:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** It's like, I like to experiment here and there.
Yes. Like I've been in the Mac ecosystem for a long time, basically because of
that. Because I just wanted to get things done and I wanted to stop, like having
to do updates or patches or whatever else. And you experiment here and there,
but, uh, that's just, you know, for funsies to get shit done.

[00:22:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** I'm very curious about this like, oh, Marchy
thing that, DHH has going out though. That sounds like he's kind of bringing
Linux to that level where like

[00:22:36] **Chuck Carpenter:** he's

[00:22:36] **Chuck Carpenter:** made a bunch of choices for you.

[00:22:38] **Robbie Wagner:** All the arch users are

[00:22:39] **Robbie Wagner:** oh my God, anyone can install

[00:22:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** now.

[00:22:41] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:22:42] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah,

[00:22:42] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah, yeah. Right.

[00:22:44] **Ali Diamond:** I am low key working on my own Linux version because
I think it'd be really funnier. there's the general Linux types that the most
average user knows, like, you know, arch Debian, but do you know about
Cali?[00:23:00]

[00:23:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:23:00] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah. , It, obviously Cali is not as popular for the
general Linux population 'cause Callie is optimized for the cybersecurity
community.

[00:23:08] **Ali Diamond:** And I'm like, ha ha, Callie, Allie.

[00:23:13] **Chuck Carpenter:** Right. Yeah. Why not?

[00:23:15] **Ali Diamond:** I wanna make the most annoying version of Callie
Linux possible. And so part of the way that I've been like trying to learn Like
how to make your own Linux version is by essentially like live on Twitch. And I
haven't worked on this in a while, so, , it's kind of a little stale right now
by basically learning live on Twitch, how to make my own Kelly Linux version.

[00:23:37] **Ali Diamond:** , And one of the things, the last things that I
worked on was like if you on your login and scream, type in your password wrong,
it would just play a sound of me screaming.

[00:23:45] **Ali Diamond:** I think that would be really good.

[00:23:49] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh my gosh.

[00:23:50] **Ali Diamond:** I want it to be annoying.

[00:23:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. Yeah. Fair

[00:23:53] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah. Ali Linox, Cali Linox phrase is like the
quieter you get.

[00:23:59] **Ali Diamond:** , [00:24:00] Oh my God, why am I blanking out on it?
There is a phrase for it, but mine was like, the quieter you get, the louder you
become. Something

[00:24:06] **Ali Diamond:** like

[00:24:06] **Ali Diamond:** that.

[00:24:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. Yeah. I am not intimately aware of Cali
Linux community or every, I've actually never installed it anywhere, but I did
know it was like cybersecurity. And when you go to, I think they want you to
come with laptops, , with its set up at most like cybersecurity conferences.
They're like, come with this.

[00:24:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** And then you, or it's like Archer that,

[00:24:30] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah. I don't know. The only cybersecurity
conference, the cybersecurity conferences I've been to, I should say, have never
told me a laptop to bring. If anything I like, I'll just bring my Mac.

[00:24:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Well to be fair, I've only been to Cactus
Con in Arizona 'cause that's where I used to live. And I went there because Jack
Reiter was gonna be there and so he's been on the show. I wanted to meet him in
person, so I was like, hell yeah, I'm going there. And they have a whole kids
track and I have children [00:25:00] and so I took my son and he went and like
soldered aboard and did some cryptography stuff.

[00:25:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** That was really cool.

[00:25:06] **Ali Diamond:** Jack is like such a sweet, sweet guy. Every time I
see him, he is always just like, you're doing amazing. Thank you.

[00:25:14] **Chuck Carpenter:** He is like the epitome of positive. Like I don't
know if I've ever met a more positive person, so I do kind of dig that. Yeah.

[00:25:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** All right. Another hot take. Let's see if we can
do two. , This I think is a good one, especially given that this is a space you
were in. Is Dere dead?

[00:25:32] **Ali Diamond:** Oh,

[00:25:35] **Chuck Carpenter:** Does it hurt too much? I mean, maybe we don't go
there. I don't

[00:25:38] **Ali Diamond:** No, no, no. We can go there. We can go there.

[00:25:40] **Ali Diamond:** I don't think that the umbrella of Dere is dead. I
think that the Derel role has been split into several different roles and a lot
of the things that companies expect when they hire a derel are [00:26:00] now
technical content creators.

[00:26:01] **Ali Diamond:** So generally Derel, you could have been a very
spectacular Devereux and not have a following and not be a content creator and
not post on LinkedIn. And like some of the best DeVeres I know don't have
followings at all. , And they've been in the field for ages, but now when a
modern company is looking for a Devra, they generally.

[00:26:26] **Ali Diamond:** Are looking for technical content creators. They're
not looking for people who know how to foster community give talks, , be
involved in open source plan events. , Know how to engage with their community
to get community feedback. Know how to, , contribute to docs in a meaningful
way, know how to check analytics to figure out, oh, this is what I need to be
focusing on for my community.

[00:26:52] **Ali Diamond:** Know how to niche down into what community groups
they should be representing in doing reach out customer conversations. I feel
like [00:27:00] that's like, that's like a different role now.

[00:27:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. It's like more marketing forward, right?
It feels like it's more the ones that exist still and that are thriving in those
roles, meaning they still have a job I feel like are so marketing forward

[00:27:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** versus like. Helping developers actually engage
in the product in a meaningful way.

[00:27:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** Like no

[00:27:23] **Robbie Wagner:** Well, is that a developer advocate though?

[00:27:26] **Chuck Carpenter:** right.

[00:27:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** And what's the difference?

[00:27:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well, I mean it's like, well what's the
difference between like a software developer and a software engineer? I almost
feel like it's just like Yeah, exactly.

[00:27:37] **Ali Diamond:** there a difference?

[00:27:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** so I personally think like software engineer is
a game that was played like a decade or so ago for like HR people to get people
into the right, salary bands so that you can sort of chase. People to stop them
from like bouncing around too much. , And then it still happened anyway, but
like [00:28:00] we were all developers and then one day we had to become
engineers because the salary bands kind of jumped up and you're chasing talent
and you're trying to get them, and you had to like validate in some way.

[00:28:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** And so they went and found like, oh yeah, a
software engineer, which does exist. But I'm not sure that it's a web
application, right? Like when you're on the web, I don't know that you're a
software engineer.

[00:28:22] **Ali Diamond:** I think a lot about how. For example, in Canada,
being an engineer is a protected class, like a doctor, a

[00:28:28] **Ali Diamond:** lawyer, things like that. , So companies can't say
they're hiring engineers because that completely, fundamentally changes the
role, the qualifications and the regulations around that.

[00:28:39] **Ali Diamond:** I feel like it's almost like going to school to
study computer science versus just wanting to be a like writing code.

[00:28:45] **CTA:** This just in! Whiskey.fund is now open for all your merch
needs. That's right, Robbie. We're hearing reports of hats, sweaters, and
T-shirts, as well as a link to join our Discord server. What's a [00:29:00]
Discord server? Just read the prompter, man. Hit subscribe. Leave us a review on
your favorite podcast app and tell your friends about our broadcast. It really
does help us reach more people and keeps the show growing. All right, back to
your regularly scheduled programming.

[00:29:18] **Robbie Wagner:** Well, even computer science, like I have a CS
degree and I think it was only a few years before I got there that it like
actually moved under engineering. So it wasn't even classified as an engineering
degree until like more recently. so

[00:29:34] **Ali Diamond:** It was a math.

[00:29:35] **Ali Diamond:** It's math. there is a fundamental provable
mathematical I remember when I took my, my, like, I think it was my ML course in
college. It was like a lot of math.

[00:29:46] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Which definitely is the case for that.
Which machine learning has nothing to do with like, , UI over crowd operations
for like. Database manipulation. Big difference, I [00:30:00] think. Yeah. And
so much SaaS is just that. It's a interface to database manipulation and maybe
you have a level where folks will run, math over top of the data that you
accumulate.

[00:30:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** And that starts to be a little more, I don't
know, engineery or mathy, but the basis of so many web apps is definitely not.

[00:30:24] **Ali Diamond:** I mean, I just always say like modern development is
just built on the shoulders of giants, so like how do you become the shoulders
that are built upon?

[00:30:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** I think that's a great question.

[00:30:35] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah.

[00:30:36] **Ali Diamond:** I think a lot about that. How do you leave a lasting
impact? How do you make something that is fundamentally core to day to day that
people really think about a lot? I don't know.

[00:30:50] **Ali Diamond:** That's a weird way to phrase it, but

[00:30:52] **Ali Diamond:** lasting impact.

[00:30:53] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. Let's get through a couple more hot takes
and then let's kind of, I wanna put a pin in that a little bit, 'cause I think I
have some [00:31:00] questions kind of related to that.

[00:31:01] **Ali Diamond:** sure.

[00:31:02] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Do we, we could probably just skip the rest
of these

[00:31:04] **Robbie Wagner:** unless the first one. The first one is very
specific if, I don't know if you want to ask that one. I don't know why that, I
don't know. Chuck wrote it. I don't know the details.

[00:31:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** I don't know. I drink a lot and then, you know,
stuff comes out or whatever

[00:31:16] **Ali Diamond:** Are you sure you don't need to like go to a, do they
have AA in Italy?

[00:31:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** , No, I don't need to. You just drink more and
then

[00:31:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** you

[00:31:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** know,

[00:31:23] **Robbie Wagner:** they call it

[00:31:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** away.

[00:31:23] **Robbie Wagner:** Alora.

[00:31:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. You know, you, I mean. Actually, what I do
is, uh, that's self-deprecating. Humor is a core part of my online persona. I,

[00:31:35] **Chuck Carpenter:** you know, so I can't fix these problems. If you
fix 'em, then I become dumb and boring.

[00:31:40] **Ali Diamond:** But what if I lose my spark?

[00:31:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** exactly.

[00:31:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** There you go.

[00:31:45] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Rails are laravel.

[00:31:47] **Ali Diamond:** I don't want to answer this

[00:31:47] **Ali Diamond:** question.

[00:31:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** you you don't want

[00:31:49] **Chuck Carpenter:** to, you just, you don't like it all.

[00:31:51] **Ali Diamond:** I,

[00:31:52] **Ali Diamond:** um,

[00:31:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** have to do anything you don't want

[00:31:53] **Ali Diamond:** my, my answer is for offline only

[00:31:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh,

[00:31:57] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh,

[00:31:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** Well,

[00:31:58] **Ali Diamond:** I, can I plead the [00:32:00] fifth on this?

[00:32:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** you absolutely can, can you promise to, give us
a little something once we stop recording?

[00:32:05] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah. You'll have to

[00:32:06] **Ali Diamond:** remember,

[00:32:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah.

[00:32:08] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, we'll, we'll remember

[00:32:09] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Robbie's like,

[00:32:11] **Ali Diamond:** but I will say this. There's a reason why PHP was
MeMed on for a really long time. I still haven't figured out why everyone's
talking about PHP. Again, I really don't understand why

[00:32:21] **Robbie Wagner:** 'cause of the

[00:32:22] **Ali Diamond:** I'm genuinely trying to figure it

[00:32:23] **Ali Diamond:** out.

[00:32:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** Lambos. I think Lambos

[00:32:25] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah. But if you wanna Lambo, go run Right.

[00:32:28] **Ali Diamond:** Scala or something and get a government job, make,
like, mad money or go work at a hedge fund, like you can make

[00:32:34] **Ali Diamond:** the

[00:32:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah. Work at a, yeah, work at a hedge fund and
you can get there. You burn out in five years and then, you know,

[00:32:40] **Chuck Carpenter:** buy an

[00:32:40] **Ali Diamond:** out about five years, that you burn out of five
years with this seven to eight figures.

[00:32:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, for sure. So that's not a bad plan. I
don't know. Yeah, I, I get you there. But I do think it's the Lambo, I think
that like. It's almost like anti Guillermo, you know?

[00:32:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** It's like Versal for PHP, Guillermo loves San
Francisco and all of that [00:33:00] culture. And Taylor's like, we ball,

[00:33:04] **Ali Diamond:** obviously, I haven't been to SF in a few years. Last
time I was there, I literally think I saw a dead body. anyways,

[00:33:09] **Chuck Carpenter:** I watched people like smoke crack and Yeah. No,
it was

[00:33:13] **Ali Diamond:** how how many Lambos have you seen in sf?

[00:33:17] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, in SF zero, Taylor doesn't live in SF for
sure. He lives somewhere like Florida or

[00:33:22] **Ali Diamond:** That's a little suspicious. How do you stand out
there and talk about Lambos when ain't nobody in SF drive in Lambos?

[00:33:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** no, they have to afford their apartment. They
can't

[00:33:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** buy a Lambo.

[00:33:33] **Ali Diamond:** So

[00:33:34] **Robbie Wagner:** $20,000 a month.

[00:33:35] **Ali Diamond:** all I'm hearing is it doesn't matter, Ruby on rails
are PHP. All I'm hearing is that you're saying Lambos and I'm saying Mm, no, low
cost of living.

[00:33:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Yeah.

[00:33:45] **Chuck Carpenter:** for

[00:33:46] **Ali Diamond:** Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

[00:33:47] **Robbie Wagner:** is sponsored by Arkansas.

[00:33:51] **Ali Diamond:** Hey, Walmart's based

[00:33:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** Mississippi. Yeah.

[00:33:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** it is actually. Yeah. That's a funny thing.
yeah, they have a like city [00:34:00] underground that they can dive into if
the world fails at any moment too.

[00:34:05] **Ali Diamond:** At the end of the day, even though I may plead the
fifth on the decision, again, it's whatever language gets the job done. I cannot
tell you the niche differences between Ruby on rails versus Laravel. I know that
each of them have their own just like, like Versel. They have their own, , cult
of personality around it that people love to pay attention to.

[00:34:25] **Ali Diamond:** And if that makes you happy, that makes you happy.
That's your special interest. I'll just admit it, coding languages are not my
special interest.

[00:34:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** no. no. It's a tribe mentality. And at the end
of the day, you can solve the problems probably with all of those things and to
the nuance that it matters from one to another. Most of us are never gonna hit,
so it doesn't, doesn't fucking matter. Right. So yeah,

[00:34:49] **Ali Diamond:** Back to my hot take

[00:34:50] **Ali Diamond:** of it. Doesn't matter the language, as long as
you're getting the job done.

[00:34:54] **Chuck Carpenter:** exactly. Solve. I like it. All right.

[00:34:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** Let's just talk tech things, [00:35:00] I guess.
Do you have some tech questions, Robbie? I don't know.

[00:35:03] **Chuck Carpenter:** You

[00:35:03] **Robbie Wagner:** I added a question or two.

[00:35:04] **Chuck Carpenter:** Did you? Please then

[00:35:06] **Robbie Wagner:** yes.

[00:35:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** I know you're tired of my voice.

[00:35:09] **Robbie Wagner:** well, it's fine. Someone has to talk. I did an
episode yesterday, so I'm already fatigued.

[00:35:14] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, so I, I was looking through your Twitter
posts and I saw one about. Hiring staff and senior roles is like what everyone
is doing 'cause they don't wanna spend time leveling up juniors.

[00:35:27] **Robbie Wagner:** And like I wanted to get your take on, is there
even a path for juniors these days? 'cause like I feel like AI has kind of like
demolished that.

[00:35:35] **Ali Diamond:** so I think that in the reality of things, the answer
right now is no. you either have to be a truly exceptional new grad. I'm
unemployed right now for the context, for the, the audiences. I'm actively
unemployed right now, and so I'm looking a lot on job boards, job websites,
reading a lot about, , the market and I rarely see just like junior engineering
opportunities.

[00:35:59] **Ali Diamond:** [00:36:00] I do see new grad opportunities, but then
when you really think about it for a new grad opportunity, you basically need to
be a mid to senior engineer at that point to even stand out from the crowd. I'm
sorry, like I don't want to be the DOR on your parade, but if you are someone
who's not going to a excellent school for engineering, like my recommendation
always is like, oh my God, please go study biology.

[00:36:24] **Ali Diamond:** Like go study chemical engineering, go study
mathematics. go study like anything but compsci because the market, the time of
the luxurious Compsci graduate is dead.

[00:36:38] **Robbie Wagner:** Yep. You heard it

[00:36:40] **Chuck Carpenter:** Can you, can you imagine how shitty this is
though? Because four years ago when folks were entering school, they were told
something very

[00:36:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** different that there was so much need and it's
growing, and how quickly that's kind of flipped. If you think about even just
for like four years, I would also conversely kind of say.

[00:36:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** [00:37:00] There's probably opportunity, but
you're gonna eat shit for a while. You're gonna go and edit WordPress sites for
a while, and you're

[00:37:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** gonna be at a very

[00:37:11] **Robbie Wagner:** ha, over half of the internet is WordPress

[00:37:13] **Chuck Carpenter:** It is. It is. But you're also gonna compete with
offshore talent,

[00:37:17] **Chuck Carpenter:** which is cheap for those purposes. So you know,
what's it gonna take? You're gonna have a micromanager who wants you to be in
St.

[00:37:25] **Chuck Carpenter:** Louis so that they can watch you do that versus
someone offshore. And that's why they're willing to pay a difference there. But
the cost of living is low and you're gonna have to eat shit through like this.
Like you gotta want it

[00:37:38] **Ali Diamond:** You have to be truly passionate about coding to get
a job in coding right now, like you have to be contributing to open source. You
need to be leak coding every day. You need to have a perfect, like, you need to
be able to solve dykstras in the most niche remote case. Doing it backwards,
upside down through like a, a straw doing a handstand [00:38:00] typing with
your eyes closed to be able to like pass a like any leak code interview right
now.

[00:38:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** And then the job is gonna

[00:38:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** be just figuring out which react hook you should

[00:38:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** use

[00:38:11] **Robbie Wagner:** it's even simpler. It's how do I move this diviv
for pixels?

[00:38:14] **Ali Diamond:** exactly. That's also why I'm like pretty anti lee
code. Just because like, unless you're going into like being a quant or
something, that is super, like niche again, doing something that's like compiler
optimization hardware. . You really don't need to know how to lead code and it
doesn't really teach you anything.

[00:38:32] **Ali Diamond:** Especially because now more than ever, lead code is
truly like a solved problem. It is a solved problem.

[00:38:38] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. I like to say, you know, if someone asks you
to do a, some kind of algorithm problem, be like, look, I'm gonna NPM install
the solution to this algorithm and I'm gonna run it. like someone else is
definitely smarter than me. And the community as a whole for sure is like, if
it's a solved thing, why do I need to memorize it all?

[00:38:55] **Ali Diamond:** Oh my god. I remember years ago I interviewed at
[00:39:00] a certain fang company and they

[00:39:02] **Ali Diamond:** asked

[00:39:02] **Robbie Wagner:** You mean, I think you mean menina?

[00:39:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, we've changed it. By the

[00:39:06] **Ali Diamond:** I thought it was manga.

[00:39:08] **Chuck Carpenter:** No, well,

[00:39:09] **Chuck Carpenter:** Robbie. Yeah, we

[00:39:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** say

[00:39:11] **Robbie Wagner:** We've coined it

[00:39:11] **Robbie Wagner:** here.

[00:39:12] **Ali Diamond:** the Muppets, so I get it and I

[00:39:13] **Ali Diamond:** fuck

[00:39:14] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. I love that. I was gonna say, I love that
you understand right

[00:39:18] **Robbie Wagner:** Yes.

[00:39:19] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah. Tu.

[00:39:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yes.

[00:39:23] **Ali Diamond:** I remember I just like looked at the interview and I
was like, yeah. So in the practicality of actually how I would do this is first
I would look up this, this like specific algorithm because I don't have it
memorized. And then I would look at how it's written and figure out how I can
take my, with my pattern matching abilities.

[00:39:38] **Ali Diamond:** I would take this solution and then implement it
here because I don't have it memorized. 'cause my brain is full of other things.
Now, did I get the job? No,

[00:39:46] **Chuck Carpenter:** right. Because you didn't do

[00:39:50] **Ali Diamond:** because I was

[00:39:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** months prep. You were,

[00:39:52] **Ali Diamond:** I

[00:39:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** do the six months prep for this one eight round
loop and, and

[00:39:58] **Robbie Wagner:** the loops are

[00:39:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** get in [00:40:00] there. Yeah, like the loops
are nuts. I've gone through eight and nine round loops just to be denied at the
end by the CEO who spoke for 30 minutes and then said, oh, you didn't contribute
enough.

[00:40:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, you didn't shut the fuck up enough. How
about that?

[00:40:15] **Ali Diamond:** I did a, I did 10 plus hours of interviewing for a
company, only for the hiring manager to put in their two weeks notice on the day
that we had our final meeting. So they turned me down.

[00:40:24] **Robbie Wagner:** Whew.

[00:40:26] **Ali Diamond:** I was a perfect fit. Like genuinely, I cannot think
of a better fit for that company because like, like what the company focused on
was something I'm very interested in.

[00:40:35] **Ali Diamond:** And like, one of the things, I wouldn't be working
on that side of the product in general, but I'm like, Hey, I am an engineer who
understands this space better than any other engineer you'll ever meet because I
am actively in this space. Here's my custom t-shirt I'm wearing. By the way, I
made this myself.

[00:40:52] **Ali Diamond:** Like I, I was literally wearing a custom t-shirt and
I was like, yeah, I just really am passionate about this space and that's why I
know about your company. And then I.

[00:40:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** And then [00:41:00] that happened and they were
like, uh, feel free to keep an eye on our openings in the future.

[00:41:06] **Chuck Carpenter:** Also, feel

[00:41:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** free to pour yourself another drink because you
know,

[00:41:10] **Ali Diamond:** Mm. I will say also one of the things that I think
that a lot, and I I, I made a YouTube video about this. I actually recently
reposted it, 'cause it was like over a year ago. We're saying that, you know,
you just said it four years ago, people were being told to get into Compsci, but
I don't think it was just like four years ago they were told into compsci, think
about when?

[00:41:29] **Ali Diamond:** 18 years ago. So four years ago is 2021. When were
those people born?

[00:41:33] **Chuck Carpenter:** That's hard math.

[00:41:35] **Chuck Carpenter:** Uh, if 20 2003,

[00:41:37] **Ali Diamond:** 2001, 2003, 2004. So throughout their childhood,
they saw the.com boom. They saw the stock market crash, they saw the housing
boom. So by the time they're 12, 11 13, it's 20 12, 20 13, 20 14. What are they
seeing and what are their parents seeing? Their parents are seeing? Oh, okay. Oh
my God, look at these stocks.

[00:41:58] **Ali Diamond:** All the news are reporting on [00:42:00] young
entrepreneurs. Mike Zuckerberg now worth a billion dollars because he started a
company on the internet and like, look at all this money that's going into tech.
And then, what's his name? So it turns out, did you know this, that the, , FANG
acronym was created by, , the Mad Money guy?

[00:42:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh.

[00:42:20] **Robbie Wagner:** Jim Kramer.

[00:42:21] **Ali Diamond:** Jim Kramer.

[00:42:22] **Ali Diamond:** created the FANG in like the FANG

[00:42:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** know that.

[00:42:25] **Ali Diamond:** in in like the, in the early 2010s. He created FANG
acronym and he was like, get in on fang. Like this is the way to go. So their
parents, you know, my dad watched Mad Money. Your parents, you know that that
information trickles down whether or not

[00:42:38] **Ali Diamond:** you're

[00:42:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** My parents are stupid and poor. That's a whole
other story.

[00:42:42] **Ali Diamond:** Whether or not your parents are knowledgeable of
that or not. Like someone will be like, oh my God, did you hear about these jobs
in tech, blah, blah.

[00:42:49] **Ali Diamond:** So now these kids are 11, 12, 13. Their parents are
like. Software. Interesting. And then they go on, they're turning 16, 17,
[00:43:00] 18. They're starting to approach college.

[00:43:01] **Ali Diamond:** By that point, you're seeing shows like Silicon
Valley, you're seeing these articles day like what's it like? Oh, software
engineers working in Silicon Valley get luxurious trips every year to go to
Paris and, and to go to Costa Rica to hang out with their companies and look at
how much money they're making and oh my God.

[00:43:20] **Ali Diamond:** And then 28, 19 20 20 21, use 2021. You see all the
influencers come out being like day in the life of, of being a software
engineer, how to make six to seven figures being a software engineer, oh my God,
look at all the money I make. So then they're going, they're going to college,
never one around them or being like, oh my God.

[00:43:41] **Ali Diamond:** Like what do you wanna study? And they're like,
software. They're not doing it 'cause they're passionate. They're doing it
'cause

[00:43:47] **Ali Diamond:** it's

[00:43:47] **Chuck Carpenter:** No. They the

[00:43:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** lifestyle.

[00:43:49] **Chuck Carpenter:** Hell yes.

[00:43:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** but also that's ?Why bootcamps existed because
it was a, learn, react, make six figures.

[00:43:57] **Ali Diamond:** exactly. Now we're just seeing that repackaged
[00:44:00] as instead of bootcamps, 10 frameworks that you need to learn in
order to make six figures as a front end engineer. Watch my video.

[00:44:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Yeah.

[00:44:08] **Robbie Wagner:** I was in general engineering, like to start and
they have a like presentation on all the different types of engineering and they
tell you which ones like make the most money. Computer science was that one at
that time that they gave that presentation. So I was like, Hey, I didn't know
which one I wanted to do, but I guess I'll do that one.

[00:44:26] **Robbie Wagner:** Like,

[00:44:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** Don't you wish you would've done industrial
engineering or something like that?

[00:44:32] **Ali Diamond:** Chemical engineering, sell to big oil, move to
Texas, own big house, own big

[00:44:37] **Ali Diamond:** car

[00:44:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** Texas.

[00:44:39] **Ali Diamond:** That's where all big

[00:44:40] **Ali Diamond:** oil is. Yeah. I've been to Texas, but I'm just
saying if you wanna make, if you wanna, if you wanna actually hard challenge of
an engineering challenge, move to Texas, become a chemical engineer, study
chemical engineering at MIT, that was the hardest major.

[00:44:53] **Ali Diamond:** and then make big money through big oil.

[00:44:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** You could go to the Emirates or

[00:44:57] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah, you could do that and make big money there
too.[00:45:00]

[00:45:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:45:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** That is a place where I've seen a lot of Lambos
and bugs and whatever else. The gas is super cheap and the roads are perfect.

[00:45:09] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah.

[00:45:10] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, it's an interesting place.

[00:45:12] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah.

[00:45:13] **Ali Diamond:** My like, journey into engineering was like very odd.
I don't talk about being the child of a, of a tech founder

[00:45:21] **Ali Diamond:** ever. I'm a child of a tech founder. Laura Drop,
yeah, my dad started a software company in the nineties,

[00:45:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** Wow.

[00:45:28] **Ali Diamond:** and he was making websites for people in the
nineties.

[00:45:31] **Ali Diamond:** He helped innovate law, , regarding technical
advancements in my home state. , My dad has had, so I don't wanna say I was
nepotist into this, like, into where I'm at right now, but because like, I
don't, he's not really involved in the space anymore, but like, my dad, like,
has had dinner with Bill Gates.

[00:45:48] **Ali Diamond:** He used to do things with Microsoft. Like my dad,
like was there for that time. So like, years ago I found like an old little,
like, what do you wanna be when you grow up and like, you write in a
kindergarten? And I, I wrote like, I wanna work with [00:46:00] computers like
my dad one day.

[00:46:02] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah. Right. Yeah. Not, not a bad influence. All
things considered. I, I'd say,

[00:46:09] **Ali Diamond:** Except now I can, I have to argue about Kubernetes
with my dad sometimes.

[00:46:16] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh yeah. I'm glad my dad has no idea what
Kubernetes is.

[00:46:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** I.

[00:46:20] **Ali Diamond:** Like my dad calls me one day, he's like, ally, like,
what do you think about Kubernetes? And I'm like, I dunno. Don't ask me, leave
me alone. Oh,

[00:46:29] **Chuck Carpenter:** Uh, dad. It's called Kates. Okay.

[00:46:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** That's what we say. All right? And, uh, I don't
know. You know, you, you ride a bunch of YAML and do

[00:46:38] **Ali Diamond:** okay. One time I was working at a startup and I was
sitting in a meeting with the founder and he was like, I was a one-on-one
meeting. And he goes, yeah, Kubernetes. And I was like,

[00:46:48] **Chuck Carpenter:** Ooh.

[00:46:48] **Ali Diamond:** and like the company like specialized in things
involving like containerization and things like that. And so I sat there and
after a few like meetings with him and I was just like, Hey, like is this
[00:47:00] like an inside joke or something?

[00:47:01] **Ali Diamond:** Like I just blatantly asked, I was like, is this an
inside joke or something? Am I not in on the joke? And he's like, what do you
mean? And I'm like. It's Kubernetes and he's like, what? And I'm like, yeah,
it's

[00:47:11] **Ali Diamond:** pronounced Kubernetes.

[00:47:12] **Chuck Carpenter:** was willing to tell him. That was the thing.
That was your superpowers. You were willing to say.

[00:47:17] **Chuck Carpenter:** Bro, you got this right? Yeah. No one told him
and then he looked like an idiot forever. So that was, yeah,

[00:47:23] **Ali Diamond:** had to correct the CEO and I was like, bro, it's
Kubernetes. Not Kubernetes.

[00:47:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. You made his life better. I think you did
a service there, so

[00:47:31] **Chuck Carpenter:** I hope he appreciates that. Yeah.

[00:47:33] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:47:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** What do you do that is not tech? You know,
there's a what not portion here, and so this is the tangents. Sometimes I play
video games, sometimes I watch random shows on flights. I always watch superhero
movies because I feel like that's the only way to really like capture yourself
into them and not overly judge them because you didn't pay $35 a ticket.

[00:47:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** So what do you do? This is not tech.

[00:47:59] **Ali Diamond:** can I [00:48:00] refine that to, what do I do that
is not software development?

[00:48:03] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:48:03] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:48:04] **Ali Diamond:** I build keyboards for people.

[00:48:06] **Ali Diamond:** I, , currently have a stack of keyboards for a
friend, for a commission.

[00:48:10] **Ali Diamond:** So I'm building, I build keyboards for people. I
also organize the net gala, which , is tech adjacent, but this is just me
raising a bunch of money to, , pay artists to make really dope art revolving
around the themes of tech, but bringing technologists together to discuss tech
in the modern society and how we can use art to impact our long-term
conversations.

[00:48:34] **Ali Diamond:** But also kind of like, now, this is something that I
don't hear , talk about a lot yet, like coding conferences, but very big in
cybersecurity conferences is lobby con I think at tech conferences. It's called
the Hallway Track, where

[00:48:46] **Ali Diamond:** you just like sit and yap. some of the best lobby
cons in tech have ended and I'm like, how can I revive lobby con and bring
together amazing people to have amazing conversations?

[00:48:58] **Ali Diamond:** So that takes a lot of [00:49:00] my time. I'm an
avid SMI ski collector. I have a lot of SMI skis.

[00:49:05] **Ali Diamond:** shall

[00:49:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** smy? Yeah, I don't know what that is. I'd love
to see one.

[00:49:09] **Ali Diamond:** I'm an avid, oh, SMI collector.

[00:49:13] **Ali Diamond:** These are my little green guys. I have a lot of
them. , They live on my desk. I have a big one also,

[00:49:19] **Chuck Carpenter:** Wait, I still don't know what a Smmi ski

[00:49:21] **Ali Diamond:** they're just little dudes doing things.

[00:49:24] **Chuck Carpenter:** Why are they called? Smis?

[00:49:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh, yes. There we go.

[00:49:28] **Ali Diamond:** I don't know. They also glow in the dark.

[00:49:31] **Ali Diamond:** I have one on my phone. I have one on my purse. I

[00:49:34] **Ali Diamond:** have at least 10 that live on my desk. I love them
so much. , They're just like, unlike Lab Booboos and Sunny Angels Sies are
actually doing things. They have work to do.

[00:49:46] **Ali Diamond:** see, this one is being, uh, girl with the Pearl
Earring.

[00:49:50] **Ali Diamond:** This one's watering its plants. these two are
moving.

[00:49:54] **Ali Diamond:** this one's getting, they have things to do also.

[00:49:56] **Ali Diamond:** This one is

[00:49:57] **Chuck Carpenter:** to do. Yeah. [00:50:00] Which we understand.

[00:50:01] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah, so I like collecting Sies. , Being in New
York, I love walking. Like genuinely I just will walk everywhere. so that is a
big thing for me is just taking really long walks around the city. I'm an avid
reader. I'm currently reading, , the second book in the Stormlight Stormlight
archives. .

[00:50:22] **Ali Diamond:** Which is Brandon Sanderson. Each book is around 1200
pages long.

[00:50:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh,

[00:50:27] **Ali Diamond:** almost done with the

[00:50:28] **Ali Diamond:** second

[00:50:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** I don't think I've read anything that long since
Game of Thrones,

[00:50:32] **Ali Diamond:** I would really recommend it. Unlike Game of Thrones,
the Stormlight archives are completed.

[00:50:37] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah. that's

[00:50:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** that's helpful.

[00:50:39] **Robbie Wagner:** is helpful. Yeah.

[00:50:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** I read graphic novels sometimes.

[00:50:44] **Ali Diamond:** I used to read a lot of graphic novels. I loved
Laura Olympus WebToons. I was a big Webtoon Scarley for a little bit.

[00:50:51] **Chuck Carpenter:** Okay. , Right now the last one I was going
through was the Invincible Compen. Uh,

[00:50:57] **Ali Diamond:** my God. I was watching, I'm watching Invisible with
[00:51:00] my friend right now,

[00:51:00] **Ali Diamond:** but

[00:51:00] **Ali Diamond:** my friends

[00:51:01] **Chuck Carpenter:** watched it yet. I wanted to read it first, and I
was like, okay, cool. Yeah, just because I, I really liked, , the boys and I
felt like that was like kind of adjacent to that whole like. Superhero who isn't
always making the right decision. Like, okay, yeah, let's go down this path.

[00:51:19] **Ali Diamond:** Such a plot twist, but I'm like, my friend's at
Burning Man right now, so I can't watch any without her. And I'm like, uh, look,
come back, but enjoy your burn.

[00:51:30] **Chuck Carpenter:** I've been to Zero Burning Man. yeah. Looks
interesting. It looks like a lot of work. I can't,

[00:51:35] **Chuck Carpenter:** I

[00:51:35] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:51:36] **Chuck Carpenter:** that.

[00:51:36] **Ali Diamond:** I have friends that are camp organizers, so they're
like actually in charge and they have to like take care of people and I'm like,
more power to you. Like some of the bigger, like well-known older camps too, so
I'm just like, enjoy your burn. Like when you come back will hang out.

[00:51:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, we're here for you. That's fine. That's
not the kind of job I want.

[00:51:56] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah.

[00:51:57] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:51:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** I think I went to the, [00:52:00] not even
Burning Man, like at all. But, , the whole Indio, California,

[00:52:06] **Ali Diamond:** Coachella.

[00:52:06] **Ali Diamond:** Coachella.

[00:52:07] **Chuck Carpenter:** Coachella. I went to Coachella I think in like
2007, about the last time. So if that like sets a tone for you, that's how

[00:52:15] **Ali Diamond:** That's the last like festival you've been to.

[00:52:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yes.

[00:52:19] **Ali Diamond:** Honestly, 2007. Coachella was probably really good.

[00:52:23] **Chuck Carpenter:** It was amazing. Yeah, it was really good.
Nine-ish Nails was one of the headliners, like block party was in the, you know,
one of the smallest stages, that kind of stuff. So it was, yeah, it was really
good. I am 47, so my party, like I'm on the senior menu.

[00:52:39] **Chuck Carpenter:** That's all

[00:52:39] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah,

[00:52:40] **Ali Diamond:** I party with people of all ages.

[00:52:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. Nothing wrong with that.

[00:52:45] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah.

[00:52:45] **Chuck Carpenter:** not ageist Robbie. He's a dick. He's, he's not,
he's,

[00:52:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** yeah,

[00:52:50] **Chuck Carpenter:** he's always like making

[00:52:52] **Chuck Carpenter:** fun of

[00:52:52] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah. I try to not hang out with Chuck and he
just, uh, just keeps showing up,

[00:52:55] **Robbie Wagner:** but

[00:52:57] **Ali Diamond:** Well, it seems like you have a combined LLC, so
there is some [00:53:00] monetary incentive here, so

[00:53:02] **Ali Diamond:** I

[00:53:02] **Ali Diamond:** hope that.

[00:53:03] **Ali Diamond:** you two have very good contracts.

[00:53:05] **Chuck Carpenter:** Right. Yeah. Yeah. We cover our bases in that
sense. And that's very, uh, you know, that's a great observation from you

[00:53:12] **Robbie Wagner:** Yes, we

[00:53:13] **Chuck Carpenter:** notice. Yeah.

[00:53:14] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah. We have too

[00:53:15] **Robbie Wagner:** if anyone's wondering

[00:53:16] **Chuck Carpenter:** of them don't do that Great.

[00:53:18] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. All of

[00:53:18] **Robbie Wagner:** them make

[00:53:19] **Ali Diamond:** corporations to high taxes. Tax

[00:53:21] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah.

[00:53:22] **Ali Diamond:** my second

[00:53:23] **Ali Diamond:** favorite activity,

[00:53:24] **Robbie Wagner:** fraud is such a, a strong

[00:53:26] **Robbie Wagner:** word, but

[00:53:27] **Chuck Carpenter:** It's a marketing expense.

[00:53:28] **Chuck Carpenter:** We did figure out how to make liquor a marketing

[00:53:31] **Chuck Carpenter:** expense. That's the best part about this

[00:53:34] **Ali Diamond:** I mean, I did literally write off. I did. I don't
know if I'm allowed to. I'll pay for it, but like I did purchase this with my
LLC

[00:53:41] **Ali Diamond:** money.

[00:53:41] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yes. We, when we made money from our services
business, we used to buy this for people. We just can't do that anymore because
we don't make money from that. So

[00:53:52] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. Need us to move a diviv, a few pixels, give
us some money.

[00:53:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, exactly. a hundred percent. Yeah. That's,
you know, it's a, it's [00:54:00] a marketing expense.

[00:54:00] **Chuck Carpenter:** You're putting yourself out there.

[00:54:02] **Ali Diamond:** because if you're listening, I am a backend software
engineer who's actively on the market looking for my next big role. If you're
interested in hiring me, please DM me on Twitter at ending with Allie because
I'm really cool and I'm fun, and I can totally be the personality hire of your
dreams.

[00:54:20] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yes. And she's not limited to Golan. She will
write whatever language that you need

[00:54:26] **Ali Diamond:** I didn't know a Lka Golan, I didn't know a Lka Golan
before my last job. And look at me now.

[00:54:32] **Chuck Carpenter:** Right, right. Well.

[00:54:33] **Ali Diamond:** I say

[00:54:34] **Ali Diamond:** that.

[00:54:34] **Chuck Carpenter:** Let, let's go ahead and pump up Ali a little
bit. You're an MIT grad. You're not only an MIT grad. You are a MIT masters

[00:54:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** graduate. Yeah. Like that's impressive. I don't
know. I didn't graduate anything. Well, high school, but,

[00:54:54] **Ali Diamond:** MIT is the only school I got into.

[00:54:56] **Chuck Carpenter:** is it the only one you applied

[00:54:58] **Chuck Carpenter:** for? [00:55:00] wow. Well, that's a good story
on its own too,

[00:55:03] **Chuck Carpenter:** so, yeah.

[00:55:05] **Ali Diamond:** it's funny. I think it's hilarious. I'm just like,
yeah, like it's the only one I got into.

[00:55:11] **Chuck Carpenter:** Would you have selected another if you,

[00:55:14] **Ali Diamond:** I may have gone, if I got into Stanford, , I
would've gone to Stanford if I had gotten into uc, Berkeley. I would've really
considered uc, Berkeley, because at the time I was also on the crew team. I did,
I was on the rowing team for nine years.

[00:55:28] **Ali Diamond:** Between high school, college, and my master's year.
I was a coxswain for both the men's and the women's teams.

[00:55:34] **Ali Diamond:** and when I was in high school, rowing was really
important to me. And so if I got into uc, Berkeley, I probably would've gone to
uc, Berkeley. But my

[00:55:42] **Chuck Carpenter:** Wait,

[00:55:43] **Ali Diamond:** withdraw.

[00:55:44] **Chuck Carpenter:** are you very tall? Are you taller than you see?

[00:55:48] **Ali Diamond:** No, I am, I'm actually, I am taller than I seem.
Yes. Most people on Twitch think I am five two.

[00:55:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** No,

[00:55:55] **Chuck Carpenter:** wouldn't have thought that. Yeah, I, I would've
put you around there. Okay.

[00:55:59] **Chuck Carpenter:** I was, [00:56:00] if you were like, surprisingly
six foot, I would've been like, wow. Would not have guessed that.

[00:56:04] **Ali Diamond:** I again, I was not a rower. was a coxswain, which is
the tiny little tiny little girl that sits in the front of the boat. So men and
women's team. Yeah.

[00:56:15] **Ali Diamond:** I've competed internationally. I've gone to
nationals, so, again, the lore is dense and complex. I just don't touch on it
because I think, , a big thing for me is that I don't want, like my time at MIT
to be the best thing I achieve in my life.

[00:56:29] **Ali Diamond:** I think that there's more to life than that. And so
like my other hobby is like social media.

[00:56:35] **Ali Diamond:** Social media is my special interest, you know?

[00:56:38] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah, that's fair. I kind of dig that. Did you
do the snowball fight?

[00:56:42] **Ali Diamond:** Yes.

[00:56:43] **Chuck Carpenter:** Yeah,

[00:56:45] **Robbie Wagner:** What?

[00:56:46] **Chuck Carpenter:** so there's a big thing every winter. There's
like a Harvard MIT snowball fight, and I don't know that because I went to
Harvard, but one of my best friends did. So,

[00:56:55] **Ali Diamond:** Oh, so my. Freshman year we did have a [00:57:00]
snowball fight. And I'm looking down because I'm looking at my ring. I wear my
class ring every day still. And on my class ring, they have a depiction of like
the MIT snowball fight because our time at MIT, we hit some of the highest
snowfall in Boston. of all time of all recorded time.

[00:57:15] **Ali Diamond:** So we had a lot of snowball fights.

[00:57:18] **Chuck Carpenter:** Nice. so it's hard to differentiate

[00:57:20] **Ali Diamond:** Between

[00:57:22] **Chuck Carpenter:** which snowball fight I would be referencing.

[00:57:24] **Ali Diamond:** Yes. That's why I asked. 'cause I was like, it was a
very specific snowball fight because also the president of MIT got involved and
he

[00:57:30] **Ali Diamond:** was

[00:57:31] **Chuck Carpenter:** Oh yeah. I was made to believe that it was like
an annual big deal,

[00:57:36] **Ali Diamond:** it probably

[00:57:36] **Chuck Carpenter:** wasn't. Yeah,

[00:57:39] **Ali Diamond:** Yeah,

[00:57:39] **Chuck Carpenter:** that's fair.
