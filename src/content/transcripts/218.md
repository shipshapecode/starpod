[00:07:19] **Taylor Desseyn:** this

[00:07:20] **Taylor Desseyn:** community

[00:07:20] **Taylor Desseyn:** team

[00:07:20] **Taylor Desseyn:** at

[00:07:20] **Taylor Desseyn:** Torque.

[00:07:21] **Taylor Desseyn:** Uh, yeah. And, uh,

[00:07:24] **Taylor Desseyn:** spent Oh. Oh

[00:07:31] **Taylor Desseyn:** gosh. Um,

[00:07:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** yeah,

[00:07:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** so

[00:07:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** I've,

[00:07:36] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm.

[00:07:36] **Taylor Desseyn:** so tired

[00:07:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** of sound

[00:07:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** effects. I'm already overstimulated, like, like
with Jason, the talk we just gave, I'm so overstimulated. , So I spent 14 years
in the staffing industry, probably placed over a thousand engineers at this
point in their, in with jobs. , In my whole focus and kind of ethos with torque
is like, welcome home.

[00:07:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** So we want this to be really a home base for you
throughout your career and whatever you want. , Whether it's a resume review or
you just wanna meet people or you wanna level [00:08:00] up in some sort of,
your job search or, or what's going to come here soon is obviously some,
technical content as well.

[00:08:06] **Taylor Desseyn:** So we

[00:08:06] **Taylor Desseyn:** just

[00:08:07] **Taylor Desseyn:** really

[00:08:07] **Taylor Desseyn:** wanna

[00:08:07] **Taylor Desseyn:** help

[00:08:07] **Taylor Desseyn:** people

[00:08:07] **Taylor Desseyn:** no matter where they're at in their career.

[00:08:09] **Robbie Wagner:** Cool. Agreed.

[00:08:11] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah. Retweet.

[00:08:13] **Jason Torres:** Definitely.

[00:08:14] **Robbie Wagner:** Speaking of which, I feel like it depends who you
ask if it's a good time to get into tech because, AI is shaking things up and in
general, , even before ai it was like money is shrinking, so it's not this like
infinite wealth,

[00:08:29] **Robbie Wagner:** like

[00:08:30] **Robbie Wagner:** get a job everywhere easily kind of thing.

[00:08:32] **Robbie Wagner:** Anymore. , Do you still think it's a good time for
people to, you know, if they're not already in a tech career, be like, Hey, let
me let me, switch and go to that.

[00:08:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** nope, was

[00:08:45] **Robbie Wagner:** a

[00:08:45] **Robbie Wagner:** yes question.

[00:08:46] **Taylor Desseyn:** No.

[00:08:47] **Taylor Desseyn:** I mean, listen.

[00:08:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** so, so

[00:08:50] **Taylor Desseyn:** I think, I think it's yes

[00:08:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** and no, right? and this is kind

[00:08:54] **Taylor Desseyn:** of

[00:08:54] **Taylor Desseyn:** alluding

[00:08:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** to,

[00:08:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** to

[00:08:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** my keynote tomorrow morning where it's.

[00:08:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** it's

[00:08:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** Everybody,

[00:08:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** honestly,

[00:08:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** is

[00:08:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** on an even

[00:08:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** playing

[00:08:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** field

[00:08:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** [00:09:00] now

[00:09:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** because

[00:09:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** of

[00:09:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** ai. right? You can go and you can learn, and you
can be really good with AI tools.

[00:09:08] **Taylor Desseyn:** Now, I would argue that you don't have maybe the
fundamentals that

[00:09:10] **Taylor Desseyn:** a senior

[00:09:11] **Taylor Desseyn:** seasoned engineer does, but for the

[00:09:13] **Taylor Desseyn:** most

[00:09:14] **Taylor Desseyn:** part, a

[00:09:14] **Taylor Desseyn:** lot

[00:09:14] **Taylor Desseyn:** of

[00:09:14] **Taylor Desseyn:** people,

[00:09:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** what are you doing,

[00:09:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** Jason?

[00:09:17] **Taylor Desseyn:** What do you,

[00:09:17] **Jason Torres:** So I'm,

[00:09:18] **Jason Torres:** I'm,

[00:09:18] **Robbie Wagner:** this?

[00:09:20] **Jason Torres:** we

[00:09:20] **Jason Torres:** have

[00:09:21] **Jason Torres:** this

[00:09:21] **Jason Torres:** wonderfully open source.

[00:09:23] **Jason Torres:** Yeah.

[00:09:25] **Jason Torres:** Of

[00:09:25] **Jason Torres:** shit.

[00:09:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** Jason, literally Our

[00:09:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** entire torque community has

[00:09:29] **Robbie Wagner:** hazed

[00:09:29] **Robbie Wagner:** me and Star

[00:09:30] **Robbie Wagner:** bingo.

[00:09:31] **Jason Torres:** They call

[00:09:31] **Jason Torres:** it tango.

[00:09:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** What happens

[00:09:32] **Robbie Wagner:** What

[00:09:33] **Robbie Wagner:** happens

[00:09:33] **Robbie Wagner:** if

[00:09:33] **Robbie Wagner:** you

[00:09:33] **Robbie Wagner:** win

[00:09:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** I'm

[00:09:34] **Jason Torres:** Oh, I'm crying.

[00:09:34] **Jason Torres:** You'll

[00:09:35] **Jason Torres:** see

[00:09:36] **Jason Torres:** here.

[00:09:36] **Jason Torres:** Well, I

[00:09:36] **Jason Torres:** can

[00:09:36] **Taylor Desseyn:** God, would you? I was trying to be thoughtful in

[00:09:40] **Jason Torres:** responses,

[00:09:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** you're

[00:09:41] **Taylor Desseyn:** out here

[00:09:41] **Taylor Desseyn:** hazing me

[00:09:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** with

[00:09:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** bingo.

[00:09:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** God bless it.

[00:09:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** So,

[00:09:46] **Taylor Desseyn:** I'm

[00:09:46] **Taylor Desseyn:** sweating.

[00:09:48] **Jason Torres:** All right, carry

[00:09:49] **Jason Torres:** on.

[00:09:49] **Taylor Desseyn:** So

[00:09:49] **Taylor Desseyn:** I, I don't know. I mean, listen, it sucks.

[00:09:51] **Taylor Desseyn:** The market sucks. I think it's getting better. I
don't think it's ever gonna rip the way it was. I do see signs of, of hiring
increase.

[00:09:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** I mean,

[00:09:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** to be [00:10:00] honest with

[00:10:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** you,

[00:10:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** Torc we're

[00:10:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** having

[00:10:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** a

[00:10:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** record year,

[00:10:02] **Taylor Desseyn:** Like

[00:10:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** we

[00:10:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** are having a record year, but I think there's a
lot of things chipping away at us hiring, right?

[00:10:08] **Taylor Desseyn:** We do a lot of lat Am that's obviously getting
hot. I think AI is making a developer, if you look at a developer as a 1.0
thing, AI's making it a 1.25 in power, not a 10 x engineer, but like a 1.25 or a
1.5 that's gonna eventually clip like chip away at the hiring for, you know,
you're not gonna see devs that have

[00:10:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** these like,

[00:10:28] **Taylor Desseyn:** or organizations have these huge dev teams.

[00:10:29] **Taylor Desseyn:** So. I think it's good. I think it's a good time
because I think you're at an even playing field when it comes to ai,

[00:10:34] **Taylor Desseyn:** but I

[00:10:34] **Taylor Desseyn:** still

[00:10:35] **Taylor Desseyn:** think

[00:10:35] **Taylor Desseyn:** it's

[00:10:35] **Taylor Desseyn:** hard as hell.

[00:10:36] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah, I think it's, , an interesting point you
said that, you know, it's harder in the US I don't know what exactly what
happened with the whole H one B Visa thing.

[00:10:44] **Robbie Wagner:** But I think that's going to be, it's going to
backfire. You're just gonna have a lot more people outside the US that get hired
because you're not gonna pay a hundred thousand dollars per dev that you're
bringing into the country. So it's like, yeah. 'cause I think they said it was
like Amazon would have to pay

[00:10:59] **Robbie Wagner:** like [00:11:00]

[00:11:00] **Robbie Wagner:** $945 million

[00:11:02] **Robbie Wagner:** a year

[00:11:02] **Robbie Wagner:** or something

[00:11:03] **Robbie Wagner:** to

[00:11:03] **Robbie Wagner:** keep

[00:11:03] **Robbie Wagner:** all

[00:11:03] **Robbie Wagner:** their people, and

[00:11:04] **Robbie Wagner:** they were like,

[00:11:04] **Jason Torres:** reasonable. Absolutely.

[00:11:05] **Jason Torres:** not

[00:11:05] **Jason Torres:** doing that,

[00:11:06] **Jason Torres:** or

[00:11:06] **Jason Torres:** whatever.

[00:11:07] **Robbie Wagner:** Like,

[00:11:07] **Jason Torres:** Small. Yeah.

[00:11:08] **Jason Torres:** That's like one week for Bezos.

[00:11:10] **Jason Torres:** no, to your point, and I guess to the question
overall though is like, I think it is a good time, but not as like just a junior
or entry level software engineer.

[00:11:20] **Jason Torres:** Like it's

[00:11:21] **Jason Torres:** evolved. Like I

[00:11:22] **Jason Torres:** think

[00:11:22] **Jason Torres:** it's a

[00:11:22] **Jason Torres:** great time to get in, maybe. Something more machine
learning focused or AI focused, like focusing on the like really hot areas I
think

[00:11:31] **Jason Torres:** is a great

[00:11:31] **Jason Torres:** time because there's

[00:11:32] **Jason Torres:** so much

[00:11:32] **Jason Torres:** growth. But again, it's like you can't just learn

[00:11:36] **Jason Torres:** me stack and

[00:11:38] **Robbie Wagner:** and expect

[00:11:38] **Robbie Wagner:** to

[00:11:38] **Jason Torres:** get

[00:11:38] **Jason Torres:** hired

[00:11:39] **Jason Torres:** anymore,

[00:11:39] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah.

[00:11:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** And and I

[00:11:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** also think too, I

[00:11:41] **Taylor Desseyn:** I I think like

[00:11:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:11:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** know

[00:11:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** AI is being used in all areas of tech, but I
think the general, like Jason said, the general software developer job is gonna
be very hard to get.

[00:11:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** However, we talk about a lot at Torque and like

[00:11:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** we have

[00:11:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** a lot

[00:11:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** of programs

[00:11:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** to get people

[00:11:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** involved. I

[00:11:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** think now's

[00:11:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** the

[00:11:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** time. Listen,

[00:11:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** if you [00:12:00] like yapping, like Josh Siri, I
just interviewed Josh Siri on my podcast last week or two weeks ago. Josh
started as a sales engineer, right? If you love yapping, there's a career for
you.

[00:12:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** If you love data, data is still, I mean, I, I
interviewed another Azure guy

[00:12:13] **Taylor Desseyn:** on

[00:12:13] **Taylor Desseyn:** my pod. Go ahead and put that down.

[00:12:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** the

[00:12:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** bingo

[00:12:16] **Taylor Desseyn:** and basically,

[00:12:17] **Taylor Desseyn:** uh,

[00:12:17] **Taylor Desseyn:** he, okay, so,

[00:12:20] **Taylor Desseyn:** so

[00:12:20] **Taylor Desseyn:** he said, he said

[00:12:21] **Taylor Desseyn:** It's still

[00:12:21] **Taylor Desseyn:** hard to find Azure people.

[00:12:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** So

[00:12:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** like I,

[00:12:24] **Taylor Desseyn:** so

[00:12:24] **Taylor Desseyn:** I think

[00:12:24] **Taylor Desseyn:** what

[00:12:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** Jason said is, is exactly right. I think going
into bootcamp, not getting any real world experience and just like,

[00:12:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** getting

[00:12:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** a mene

[00:12:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** stack

[00:12:34] **Taylor Desseyn:** job,

[00:12:35] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:12:35] **Taylor Desseyn:** think

[00:12:35] **Taylor Desseyn:** is

[00:12:35] **Taylor Desseyn:** a

[00:12:35] **Taylor Desseyn:** thing

[00:12:35] **Taylor Desseyn:** of the past.

[00:12:36] **Jason Torres:** , you mentioned, , Azure I

[00:12:38] **Jason Torres:** think it, I

[00:12:39] **Jason Torres:** think

[00:12:39] **Jason Torres:** it's

[00:12:39] **Jason Torres:** in because there's so

[00:12:40] **Jason Torres:** many legacy

[00:12:41] **Jason Torres:** code

[00:12:42] **Jason Torres:** bases that

[00:12:42] **Jason Torres:** people

[00:12:43] **Jason Torres:** are just

[00:12:43] **Jason Torres:** like

[00:12:43] **Jason Torres:** we were talking

[00:12:44] **Jason Torres:** about

[00:12:44] **Jason Torres:** mainframe

[00:12:44] **Jason Torres:** last

[00:12:44] **Jason Torres:** night.

[00:12:44] **Jason Torres:** kind of retiring

[00:12:46] **Jason Torres:** out of ball plays a

[00:12:47] **Jason Torres:** lot. Oh

[00:12:47] **Jason Torres:** dude,

[00:12:47] **Jason Torres:** But that's, that's

[00:12:48] **Jason Torres:** the thing. There aren't

[00:12:49] **Robbie Wagner:** engineers

[00:12:50] **Robbie Wagner:** for

[00:12:50] **Robbie Wagner:** those

[00:12:51] **Robbie Wagner:** things because

[00:12:52] **Robbie Wagner:** again, like

[00:12:53] **Robbie Wagner:** because you can't write JSX for it.

[00:12:54] **Robbie Wagner:** If they

[00:12:55] **Robbie Wagner:** make

[00:12:55] **Robbie Wagner:** COBOL that

[00:12:55] **Jason Torres:** runs

[00:12:56] **Jason Torres:** JSX,

[00:12:57] **Jason Torres:** Jesus.

[00:12:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** is, but okay.

[00:12:58] **Jason Torres:** it's

[00:12:59] **Jason Torres:** uh,

[00:12:59] **Jason Torres:** like

[00:12:59] **Jason Torres:** the

[00:12:59] **Jason Torres:** [00:13:00] syntax

[00:13:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** is that another

[00:13:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** one?

[00:13:01] **Robbie Wagner:** would you

[00:13:01] **Robbie Wagner:** say

[00:13:01] **Robbie Wagner:** maybe you're

[00:13:02] **Robbie Wagner:** not

[00:13:02] **Jason Torres:** technical.

[00:13:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** I'm not. you.

[00:13:08] **Taylor Desseyn:** Oh,

[00:13:08] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh,

[00:13:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** This is what I, I deal with all the time.

[00:13:11] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah.

[00:13:12] **Robbie Wagner:** , Okay. So yeah. Related

[00:13:14] **Robbie Wagner:** in

[00:13:14] **Robbie Wagner:** terms of what

[00:13:14] **Robbie Wagner:** you

[00:13:15] **Robbie Wagner:** guys

[00:13:15] **Robbie Wagner:** do. I'm wondering if there's any movement towards
a switch where like instead of the volume game of placing a lot of people,
'cause there's like that story about the guy that got like a billion dollar
offer for like doing machine learning stuff.

[00:13:29] **Robbie Wagner:** do you just go after one whale a year or something
and like a whole company can work up, be like his

[00:13:34] **Robbie Wagner:** agent

[00:13:35] **Robbie Wagner:** of like,

[00:13:36] **Taylor Desseyn:** so

[00:13:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah, I mean, so few years ago I read, , that.
That was kind of happening in San Francisco. , I actually read recently that, ,
hedge funds were like starting to do that, like, like private. I'm not
butchering it here. My brain's going out. But yeah, there's people negotiating,
, like hedge funds, , type guys.

[00:13:54] **Taylor Desseyn:** Because of latam, because of offshore, because
[00:14:00] of the

[00:14:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** market being

[00:14:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** more commoditized with ai, you're seeing salaries
come down

[00:14:05] **Taylor Desseyn:** and so I don't think you're going again as a
traditional software engineer. I think the path is

[00:14:11] **Taylor Desseyn:** machine

[00:14:11] **Taylor Desseyn:** learning,

[00:14:12] **Taylor Desseyn:** NLP, computer vision.

[00:14:14] **Taylor Desseyn:** We are going through the next evolution of the
web. This is on my keynote talk tomorrow. We're

[00:14:18] **Taylor Desseyn:** in

[00:14:18] **Taylor Desseyn:** a similar pattern right now,

[00:14:19] **Taylor Desseyn:** is when

[00:14:19] **Taylor Desseyn:** React came out, there

[00:14:20] **Taylor Desseyn:** were people

[00:14:21] **Taylor Desseyn:** who

[00:14:21] **Taylor Desseyn:** wanted to,

[00:14:25] **Jason Torres:** literally

[00:14:26] **Jason Torres:** react.

[00:14:27] **Robbie Wagner:** What

[00:14:27] **Robbie Wagner:** If

[00:14:28] **Robbie Wagner:** you

[00:14:28] **Taylor Desseyn:** writing React?

[00:14:28] **Taylor Desseyn:** What

[00:14:29] **Taylor Desseyn:** might

[00:14:29] **Robbie Wagner:** you

[00:14:29] **Robbie Wagner:** write

[00:14:29] **Robbie Wagner:** it in?

[00:14:30] **Taylor Desseyn:** I don't know, dude, I'm not technical. Put that

[00:14:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** down. , But what I'm saying is, is that no, when

[00:14:35] **Taylor Desseyn:** React

[00:14:35] **Taylor Desseyn:** came

[00:14:36] **Taylor Desseyn:** out,

[00:14:36] **Taylor Desseyn:** there were

[00:14:36] **Taylor Desseyn:** people

[00:14:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** who

[00:14:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** jumped

[00:14:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** on

[00:14:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** it.

[00:14:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** The

[00:14:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** people who

[00:14:38] **Taylor Desseyn:** stuck

[00:14:38] **Taylor Desseyn:** their

[00:14:38] **Taylor Desseyn:** head in

[00:14:38] **Taylor Desseyn:** the

[00:14:38] **Taylor Desseyn:** sand. Yeah, and those people who stuck their head
in the sand.

[00:14:41] **Taylor Desseyn:** I still know people to

[00:14:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** this

[00:14:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** day who chose

[00:14:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** to

[00:14:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** not learn, react, and they consistently

[00:14:45] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. What losers, who

[00:14:47] **Robbie Wagner:** would

[00:14:47] **Robbie Wagner:** do that?

[00:14:48] **Robbie Wagner:** That's me.

[00:14:50] **Taylor Desseyn:** There you go. wait a

[00:14:51] **Taylor Desseyn:** second. There you

[00:14:51] **Taylor Desseyn:** go. But I know others have struggled to find a
job. We are

[00:14:54] **Taylor Desseyn:** in that next

[00:14:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** evolution. Ai,

[00:14:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** if you

[00:14:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** don't

[00:14:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** know where it's

[00:14:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** going

[00:14:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** and

[00:14:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** you

[00:14:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** don't

[00:14:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** learn

[00:14:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** [00:15:00] it,

[00:15:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:15:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** think three

[00:15:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** to

[00:15:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** five

[00:15:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** years

[00:15:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** you're

[00:15:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** behind.

[00:16:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** your network.

[00:16:54] **Taylor Desseyn:** more

[00:16:54] **Taylor Desseyn:** than

[00:16:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** ever,

[00:16:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** People

[00:16:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** are finding jobs and they're doing it through
their network. Right. Like I am [00:17:00] bringing on every time. Somebody I
know either directly know or kind of is in my like first connection, second

[00:17:05] **Taylor Desseyn:** connection on Twitter

[00:17:06] **Taylor Desseyn:** or LinkedIn, that find a

[00:17:07] **Taylor Desseyn:** job.

[00:17:08] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:17:08] **Taylor Desseyn:** reach

[00:17:08] **Taylor Desseyn:** out to them and ask them

[00:17:10] **Taylor Desseyn:** how

[00:17:10] **Taylor Desseyn:** did they

[00:17:10] **Taylor Desseyn:** find it?

[00:17:11] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:17:12] **Taylor Desseyn:** 90%

[00:17:13] **Taylor Desseyn:** of the

[00:17:13] **Taylor Desseyn:** answers

[00:17:14] **Taylor Desseyn:** from

[00:17:14] **Taylor Desseyn:** a

[00:17:14] **Taylor Desseyn:** friend, the problem is is that it goes against
everything

[00:17:20] **Taylor Desseyn:** we're taught as humans, we confuse activity with
productivity in that we're gonna submit a thousand

[00:17:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** applicants.

[00:17:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** our applications, we think that's gonna help.

[00:17:29] **Taylor Desseyn:** When in actuality you come

[00:17:31] **Taylor Desseyn:** into

[00:17:31] **Taylor Desseyn:** this

[00:17:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** thing,

[00:17:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** spending

[00:17:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** three days. I mean, there was one guy at our
meetup last night

[00:17:36] **Taylor Desseyn:** that said

[00:17:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** he

[00:17:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** got

[00:17:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** a

[00:17:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** job

[00:17:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** at

[00:17:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** our meetup or like an offer.

[00:17:39] **Taylor Desseyn:** like, like

[00:17:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** a, like a,

[00:17:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** verbal.

[00:17:41] **Taylor Desseyn:** That

[00:17:41] **Taylor Desseyn:** doesn't

[00:17:41] **Taylor Desseyn:** happen

[00:17:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** if

[00:17:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** you're

[00:17:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** online.

[00:17:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** Right. And so

[00:17:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** that's why

[00:17:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** we're really big in kind of bringing it back to
torque, is like we do the virtual events, we have the

[00:17:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** tech commute, we have

[00:17:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** the guidance counselor 2.0,

[00:17:50] **Taylor Desseyn:** we have the

[00:17:50] **Taylor Desseyn:** resume reviews, we have all that stuff.

[00:17:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** But

[00:17:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** at the

[00:17:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** end

[00:17:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** of the day,

[00:17:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** you

[00:17:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** still have to show up. You still have to shake

[00:17:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** hands. And

[00:17:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** that is

[00:17:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** really

[00:17:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** what

[00:17:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** set and that, and that's

[00:17:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** why

[00:17:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** I,

[00:17:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** hired

[00:17:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** him,

[00:17:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** going back

[00:17:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** to

[00:17:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** him.

[00:17:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** [00:18:00] Like

[00:18:00] **Jason Torres:** full circle. hired him.

[00:18:01] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:18:02] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. I mean, it's also easier for like, you know,
everybody's getting a thousand applicants per job and they're like, well shit, I
don't want to go

[00:18:09] **Robbie Wagner:** through these.

[00:18:09] **Robbie Wagner:** So

[00:18:10] **Robbie Wagner:** if they have someone they know that

[00:18:11] **Robbie Wagner:** like.

[00:18:12] **Robbie Wagner:** It's

[00:18:12] **Robbie Wagner:** like,

[00:18:12] **Robbie Wagner:** Hey,

[00:18:12] **Robbie Wagner:** you can

[00:18:12] **Robbie Wagner:** put

[00:18:12] **Robbie Wagner:** me

[00:18:13] **Robbie Wagner:** in as a referral.

[00:18:13] **Robbie Wagner:** And they do, Then

[00:18:14] **Robbie Wagner:** they're

[00:18:14] **Robbie Wagner:** gonna

[00:18:14] **Robbie Wagner:** be like,

[00:18:14] **Robbie Wagner:** AHS, so

[00:18:15] **Robbie Wagner:** much easier

[00:18:15] **Robbie Wagner:** for

[00:18:15] **Robbie Wagner:** me.

[00:18:15] **Robbie Wagner:** I don't

[00:18:16] **Robbie Wagner:** want to do that.

[00:18:17] **Robbie Wagner:** So

[00:18:17] **Jason Torres:** that's why we advocate for the community a lot more
too, because again, it's when

[00:18:21] **Jason Torres:** you know those people

[00:18:22] **Jason Torres:** and then a role comes up like who's

[00:18:24] **Jason Torres:** the, who's

[00:18:24] **Jason Torres:** top of

[00:18:24] **Jason Torres:** mind,

[00:20:43] **Robbie Wagner:** source,

[00:20:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** source. Now

[00:20:45] **Robbie Wagner:** is

[00:20:45] **Robbie Wagner:** it?

[00:20:45] **Taylor Desseyn:** saying Java's open

[00:20:46] **Taylor Desseyn:** source?

[00:20:47] **Robbie Wagner:** no.

[00:20:48] **Robbie Wagner:** no. I'm

[00:20:48] **Robbie Wagner:** just

[00:20:48] **Robbie Wagner:** like

[00:20:49] **Robbie Wagner:** being

[00:20:49] **Jason Torres:** like,

[00:20:50] **Jason Torres:** is

[00:20:50] **Jason Torres:** that one

[00:20:50] **Jason Torres:** of

[00:20:50] **Jason Torres:** them?

[00:20:51] **Jason Torres:** Yeah.

[00:20:51] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah. Damn

[00:20:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** Hots.

[00:20:52] **Jason Torres:** Hot.

[00:21:26] **Jason Torres:** I mean,

[00:21:27] **Jason Torres:** I

[00:21:27] **Jason Torres:** don't,

[00:21:27] **Robbie Wagner:** don't

[00:21:28] **Robbie Wagner:** know

[00:21:28] **Robbie Wagner:** what

[00:21:28] **Robbie Wagner:** all is open

[00:21:28] **Robbie Wagner:** source,

[00:21:29] **Robbie Wagner:** but I

[00:21:29] **Robbie Wagner:** think

[00:21:29] **Robbie Wagner:** the

[00:21:30] **Robbie Wagner:** web

[00:21:30] **Robbie Wagner:** is

[00:21:30] **Robbie Wagner:** open

[00:21:30] **Robbie Wagner:** source.

[00:21:30] **Robbie Wagner:** So

[00:21:31] **Jason Torres:** think

[00:21:31] **Jason Torres:** that's

[00:21:31] **Jason Torres:** kind

[00:21:31] **Jason Torres:** of a redundant

[00:21:31] **Jason Torres:** question.

[00:21:32] **Jason Torres:** Mm-hmm.

[00:21:32] **Jason Torres:** I

[00:21:33] **Jason Torres:** guess

[00:21:33] **Jason Torres:** most

[00:21:33] **Jason Torres:** of things

[00:21:33] **Jason Torres:** on the

[00:21:34] **Jason Torres:** web

[00:21:34] **Jason Torres:** are

[00:21:34] **Jason Torres:** it's subjective. Yeah.

[00:21:35] **Jason Torres:** It's like how

[00:21:37] **Jason Torres:** important is

[00:21:37] **Jason Torres:** a

[00:21:37] **Jason Torres:** good resume? How important is

[00:21:39] **Jason Torres:** work

[00:21:39] **Jason Torres:** experience? How important is your, like technical
acumen? So you can

[00:21:43] **Jason Torres:** pick, It depends.

[00:21:44] **Jason Torres:** It it

[00:21:44] **Jason Torres:** does, No,

[00:21:45] **Jason Torres:** it does,

[00:21:45] **Jason Torres:** because

[00:21:46] **Jason Torres:** you know,

[00:21:46] **Jason Torres:** it

[00:21:46] **Jason Torres:** also depends

[00:21:47] **Jason Torres:** on

[00:21:47] **Jason Torres:** like what

[00:21:48] **Jason Torres:** kind of orgs you're going after. Like some places
aren't open source, they don't give a shit. Like what, what would that be a
benefit to you to even be interacting with then? So I,

[00:21:57] **Jason Torres:** I

[00:21:57] **Jason Torres:** think

[00:21:57] **Jason Torres:** it's very

[00:21:58] **Jason Torres:** relative

[00:21:58] **Jason Torres:** to

[00:21:59] **Jason Torres:** the [00:22:00] scenario

[00:22:00] **Jason Torres:** completely

[00:22:01] **Jason Torres:** as

[00:22:01] **Jason Torres:** is

[00:22:01] **Jason Torres:** anything

[00:22:01] **Jason Torres:** though.

[00:22:02] **Jason Torres:** It's like, either side

[00:22:03] **Jason Torres:** of it.

[00:22:03] **Jason Torres:** I

[00:22:03] **Jason Torres:** think

[00:22:04] **Taylor Desseyn:** open

[00:22:04] **Taylor Desseyn:** source

[00:22:04] **Taylor Desseyn:** to me

[00:22:05] **Taylor Desseyn:** is

[00:22:05] **Taylor Desseyn:** less,

[00:22:06] **Taylor Desseyn:** ,

[00:22:06] **Taylor Desseyn:** Tech

[00:22:06] **Taylor Desseyn:** more community.

[00:22:08] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah.

[00:22:08] **Taylor Desseyn:** Right?

[00:22:08] **Taylor Desseyn:** Like to

[00:22:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** me

[00:22:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** it's like,

[00:22:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** like I

[00:22:10] **Taylor Desseyn:** think

[00:22:10] **Taylor Desseyn:** Todd

[00:22:11] **Taylor Desseyn:** has done, shout out Todd Lewis again.

[00:22:12] **Taylor Desseyn:** Fellow South Carolina Gamecock grad. this

[00:22:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** conference

[00:22:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** is

[00:22:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** a little different, right? I

[00:22:16] **Taylor Desseyn:** was telling Jason

[00:22:16] **Taylor Desseyn:** this,

[00:22:17] **Taylor Desseyn:** this

[00:22:17] **Taylor Desseyn:** isn't tech Twitter, like

[00:22:18] **Taylor Desseyn:** there's obviously

[00:22:19] **Taylor Desseyn:** tech

[00:22:19] **Taylor Desseyn:** Twitter here.

[00:22:20] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:22:21] **Robbie Wagner:** no

[00:22:21] **Jason Torres:** tech.

[00:22:21] **Taylor Desseyn:** This is

[00:22:21] **Taylor Desseyn:** a very,

[00:22:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** and,

[00:22:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** and, and commit

[00:22:24] **Taylor Desseyn:** your code

[00:22:24] **Taylor Desseyn:** with, with

[00:22:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** Shout

[00:22:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** out Danny.

[00:22:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:22:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** mean, hell of,

[00:22:26] **Jason Torres:** of, Hell

[00:22:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** of an

[00:22:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** event. I

[00:22:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** dropped my vlog today. Check it out. youtube.com
back slash to. I know you

[00:22:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** looking for that.

[00:22:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** you should

[00:22:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** say

[00:22:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** self-promotion, which should be one of

[00:22:35] **Taylor Desseyn:** them

[00:22:35] **Taylor Desseyn:** anyways. But

[00:22:36] **Taylor Desseyn:** like for me,

[00:22:38] **Taylor Desseyn:** open source. Is the community.

[00:22:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** And I think Todd's done such a great job
fostering, and Todd shows

[00:22:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** that

[00:22:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** you

[00:22:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** don't need a discord, that you don't need a
slack, you just need location, time, and great content because he's

[00:22:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** throwing meetups

[00:22:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** with two,

[00:22:54] **Taylor Desseyn:** when

[00:22:54] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:22:54] **Taylor Desseyn:** spoke,

[00:22:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** 200

[00:22:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** people showed up, 200

[00:22:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** people,

[00:22:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** two

[00:22:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** ain't

[00:22:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** meetup.

[00:22:58] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah,

[00:22:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** That's

[00:22:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** not [00:23:00] happening in Nashville.

[00:23:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** That's not happening

[00:23:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** in Nashville. And so. Again, open source to me is
more of a community mind mindset than

[00:23:07] **Taylor Desseyn:** a

[00:23:07] **Taylor Desseyn:** tech mindset.

[00:23:08] **Taylor Desseyn:** And I think

[00:23:08] **Taylor Desseyn:** yes,

[00:23:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:23:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** think

[00:23:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** to

[00:23:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** have that

[00:23:10] **Taylor Desseyn:** mindset

[00:23:10] **Taylor Desseyn:** and to

[00:23:10] **Taylor Desseyn:** being community is

[00:23:11] **Jason Torres:** community, I agree with that.

[00:23:13] **Jason Torres:** Totally. Yeah. I appreciate you

[00:23:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** with me on.

[00:23:16] **Jason Torres:** at the same time, I think that it is an opportunity
for people to like get involved in different ways. And again, it's like
community based. We built a repository for hack Tober Fest just so

[00:23:27] **Jason Torres:** people

[00:23:27] **Jason Torres:** could contribute

[00:23:28] **Jason Torres:** and

[00:23:28] **Jason Torres:** like

[00:23:29] **Jason Torres:** get

[00:23:29] **Jason Torres:** involved

[00:23:30] **Jason Torres:** with open

[00:23:30] **Jason Torres:** source.

[00:23:30] **Jason Torres:** Is

[00:23:31] **Jason Torres:** he

[00:23:31] **Jason Torres:** still taking

[00:23:32] **Jason Torres:** pictures?

[00:23:32] **Jason Torres:** He's still taking

[00:23:33] **Jason Torres:** pictures,

[00:23:34] **Taylor Desseyn:** gotta gotta get the content.

[00:23:37] **Jason Torres:** but yeah,

[00:23:37] **Jason Torres:** I mean,

[00:23:38] **Jason Torres:** I,

[00:23:38] **Jason Torres:** I

[00:23:38] **Jason Torres:** think

[00:23:38] **Jason Torres:** it

[00:23:38] **Jason Torres:** has

[00:23:39] **Jason Torres:** a,

[00:23:41] **Jason Torres:** a varying

[00:23:41] **Jason Torres:** degree of

[00:23:42] **Jason Torres:** effectiveness

[00:23:43] **Jason Torres:** as to how it can get you a job.

[00:23:44] **Jason Torres:** I think

[00:23:45] **Robbie Wagner:** again,

[00:23:45] **Robbie Wagner:** Yes.

[00:23:45] **Jason Torres:** how you

[00:23:46] **Jason Torres:** leverage it. Yeah. So,

[00:23:48] **Robbie Wagner:** True, true.

[00:23:48] **Robbie Wagner:** All right, so

[00:23:49] **Robbie Wagner:** you

[00:23:49] **Robbie Wagner:** mentioned the

[00:23:49] **Robbie Wagner:** Gamecocks. Yeah.

[00:23:51] **Robbie Wagner:** So, uh,

[00:23:52] **Robbie Wagner:** you think Shane Beamer will, uh, come to Virginia
Tech. Uh,

[00:23:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** they, so, so

[00:23:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** you

[00:23:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** hope he

[00:23:57] **Robbie Wagner:** does?

[00:23:57] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:23:58] **Robbie Wagner:** So

[00:23:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** So I will

[00:23:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** tell

[00:23:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** you

[00:23:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** this.

[00:23:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** There

[00:23:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** [00:24:00] is,

[00:24:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** sorry.

[00:24:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** Uh,

[00:24:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** you

[00:24:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** can't really,

[00:24:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** contribute here

[00:24:02] **Taylor Desseyn:** in this conversation. Yeah, yeah,

[00:24:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** yeah.

[00:24:04] **Taylor Desseyn:** So,

[00:24:04] **Jason Torres:** So,

[00:24:12] **Taylor Desseyn:** that far

[00:24:12] **Taylor Desseyn:** north.

[00:24:13] **Taylor Desseyn:** , So

[00:24:13] **Taylor Desseyn:** basically there is, I've seen some tweets

[00:24:16] **Taylor Desseyn:** where

[00:24:17] **Taylor Desseyn:** from

[00:24:18] **Taylor Desseyn:** a South Carolina football perspective, there's so
much

[00:24:20] **Taylor Desseyn:** bad happening on the field. people

[00:24:22] **Taylor Desseyn:** are

[00:24:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** saying

[00:24:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** it's almost like neglect

[00:24:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** to

[00:24:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** where

[00:24:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** a

[00:24:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** coach

[00:24:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** can't

[00:24:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** be

[00:24:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** that

[00:24:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** neglectful unless

[00:24:28] **Taylor Desseyn:** he's already

[00:24:28] **Taylor Desseyn:** checked out.

[00:24:30] **Robbie Wagner:** Ah,

talking about, yes. That

[00:25:31] **Taylor Desseyn:** some people

[00:25:31] **Taylor Desseyn:** think

[00:25:31] **Taylor Desseyn:** software

[00:25:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** engineers make too much money.

[00:25:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah.

[00:25:34] **Taylor Desseyn:** but

[00:25:34] **Taylor Desseyn:** we're

[00:25:59] **Robbie Wagner:** and

[00:25:59] **Robbie Wagner:** he's [00:26:00] a college athlete. Think about if
you're the

[00:26:02] **Robbie Wagner:** other guy on the

[00:26:03] **Robbie Wagner:** team.

[00:26:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** think

[00:26:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** is 1.9. I think Le Nors is like 1.2.

[00:26:05] **Taylor Desseyn:** Imagine

[00:26:06] **Robbie Wagner:** Like imagine you're

[00:26:07] **Robbie Wagner:** like,

[00:26:08] **Robbie Wagner:** I don't know, a

[00:26:08] **Robbie Wagner:** generic

[00:26:09] **Robbie Wagner:** linebacker.

[00:26:10] **Taylor Desseyn:** what 1.9

[00:26:11] **Taylor Desseyn:** carries

[00:26:11] **Taylor Desseyn:** in

[00:26:12] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh yeah.

[00:26:13] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah.

[00:26:14] **Jason Torres:** Patrick Mahomes

[00:26:15] **Jason Torres:** signed

[00:26:16] **Jason Torres:** a

[00:26:16] **Jason Torres:** contract extension

[00:26:17] **Jason Torres:** with the,

[00:26:18] **Jason Torres:** $450 million over 10

[00:26:22] **Robbie Wagner:** Dang.

[00:26:22] **Taylor Desseyn:** 40 a year.

[00:26:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** Well,

[00:26:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** yeah, People watch

[00:26:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** that.

[00:26:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** Not your

[00:26:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** mustache. okay,

[00:26:29] **Taylor Desseyn:** but

[00:26:29] **Taylor Desseyn:** this

[00:26:29] **Taylor Desseyn:** isn't

[00:26:30] **Jason Torres:** about

[00:26:30] **Jason Torres:** me.

[00:26:30] **Jason Torres:** I'm

[00:26:31] **Jason Torres:** just

[00:26:31] **Jason Torres:** saying

[00:26:31] **Jason Torres:** in

[00:26:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** like,

[00:26:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** what do you

[00:26:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** want?

[00:26:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** Carl,

[00:26:32] **Jason Torres:** pro athletes

[00:26:34] **Taylor Desseyn:** think she

[00:26:34] **Taylor Desseyn:** get paid the

[00:26:34] **Taylor Desseyn:** most? Who do you think she get paid the most?

[00:26:36] **Jason Torres:** i

[00:26:36] **Jason Torres:** have

[00:26:36] **Jason Torres:** no

[00:26:36] **Jason Torres:** problem with

[00:26:37] **Jason Torres:** them

[00:26:38] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, I, I don't think

[00:26:39] **Jason Torres:** amount of money. I think,

[00:26:41] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:26:41] **Robbie Wagner:** don't know. You, you guys might feel differently,
but I think teachers should

[00:26:44] **Robbie Wagner:** make the

[00:26:44] **Robbie Wagner:** most,

[00:26:44] **Robbie Wagner:** and

[00:26:45] **Robbie Wagner:** first responders, shit like that,

[00:26:47] **Taylor Desseyn:** this

[00:26:47] **Taylor Desseyn:** could get

[00:26:47] **Taylor Desseyn:** extremely

[00:26:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** outta

[00:26:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** control,

[00:26:49] **Taylor Desseyn:** but

[00:26:49] **Taylor Desseyn:** the way

[00:26:50] **Taylor Desseyn:** the government is set up,

[00:26:51] **Taylor Desseyn:** it

[00:26:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** does

[00:26:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** not

[00:26:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** incentivize productivity.

[00:26:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** And

[00:26:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** I think

[00:26:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** government,

[00:26:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** high

[00:26:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** elected

[00:26:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** officials

[00:26:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** should

[00:26:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** get

[00:26:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** paid like

[00:26:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** CEOs. [00:27:00]

[00:27:00] **Jason Torres:** No, no.

[00:27:01] **Jason Torres:** I disagree. The results.

[00:27:03] **Jason Torres:** Yeah.

[00:27:03] **Jason Torres:** I

[00:27:03] **Jason Torres:** dis, I disagree. I don't think that

[00:27:05] **Jason Torres:** a governor

[00:27:06] **Jason Torres:** needs

[00:27:06] **Jason Torres:** to

[00:27:06] **Jason Torres:** make half a million dollars

[00:27:08] **Jason Torres:** and live

[00:27:08] **Jason Torres:** in a house

[00:27:09] **Jason Torres:** that

[00:27:09] **Jason Torres:** is

[00:27:09] **Jason Torres:** paid for by

[00:27:10] **Jason Torres:** me.

[00:27:12] **Taylor Desseyn:** Well,

[00:27:13] **Taylor Desseyn:** it

[00:27:13] **Taylor Desseyn:** would

[00:27:13] **Jason Torres:** be, again,

[00:27:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** I'm not

[00:27:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** saying.

[00:27:16] **Jason Torres:** or

[00:27:16] **Jason Torres:** how

[00:27:16] **Jason Torres:** about

[00:27:17] **Jason Torres:** a

[00:27:17] **Jason Torres:** superintendent

[00:27:18] **Jason Torres:** of

[00:27:18] **Taylor Desseyn:** already do.

[00:27:18] **Taylor Desseyn:** What are

[00:27:18] **Taylor Desseyn:** you talking

[00:27:19] **Taylor Desseyn:** about?

[00:27:19] **Taylor Desseyn:** That's

[00:27:20] **Taylor Desseyn:** what, I'm

[00:27:21] **Taylor Desseyn:** saying. That's what I'm saying. Tie them to
results.

[00:27:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** Oh, yeah,

[00:27:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** yeah,

[00:27:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** yeah.

[00:27:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** That's what

[00:27:24] **Taylor Desseyn:** I'm

[00:27:24] **Taylor Desseyn:** saying. No, be

[00:27:24] **Taylor Desseyn:** held

[00:27:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** accountable

[00:27:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** to

[00:27:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** a, to

[00:27:26] **Jason Torres:** specific

[00:27:27] **Jason Torres:** results.

[00:27:27] **Jason Torres:** Like

[00:27:27] **Jason Torres:** a CEO.

[00:27:28] **Jason Torres:** Yeah.

[00:27:29] **Jason Torres:** like,

[00:27:29] **Taylor Desseyn:** like,

[00:27:29] **Taylor Desseyn:** if

[00:27:30] **Taylor Desseyn:** you're

[00:27:30] **Taylor Desseyn:** the

[00:27:30] **Taylor Desseyn:** president

[00:27:30] **Taylor Desseyn:** now again,

[00:27:31] **Taylor Desseyn:** this,

[00:27:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** we

[00:27:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** are.

[00:27:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** going

[00:27:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** down a very scary Yeah. That's,

[00:27:36] **Taylor Desseyn:** all

[00:27:36] **Taylor Desseyn:** time Yeah. Yeah.

[00:27:37] **Jason Torres:** it was great seeing you

[00:27:38] **Taylor Desseyn:** but

[00:27:38] **Taylor Desseyn:** like, you know,

[00:27:39] **Taylor Desseyn:** set objectives,

[00:27:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** right. Anyways.

[00:27:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah. Listen,

[00:27:41] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:27:41] **Taylor Desseyn:** am not

[00:27:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** a

[00:27:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** political guy,

[00:27:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** but I do think

[00:27:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** there should be. government officials should be
paid and compensated like corporate CEOs

[00:27:49] **Taylor Desseyn:** because

[00:27:50] **Taylor Desseyn:** if the government

[00:27:51] **Taylor Desseyn:** operated

[00:27:51] **Taylor Desseyn:** like

[00:27:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** a Nvidia or an Apple,

[00:27:55] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:27:55] **Robbie Wagner:** I'm

[00:27:55] **Robbie Wagner:** sure

[00:27:55] **Robbie Wagner:** the results

[00:27:56] **Robbie Wagner:** better

[00:27:57] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, that's,

[00:27:58] **Robbie Wagner:** And, that's

[00:27:59] **Robbie Wagner:** that's part of. [00:28:00]

[00:28:00] **Jason Torres:** Agnos.

[00:28:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** for the record.

[00:28:01] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. If there's no incentive, incentive,

[00:28:02] **Robbie Wagner:** to do well,

[00:28:03] **Robbie Wagner:** then why

[00:28:04] **Robbie Wagner:** would

[00:28:04] **Robbie Wagner:** you try? There's

[00:28:04] **Jason Torres:** There's

[00:28:05] **Taylor Desseyn:** no

[00:28:05] **Taylor Desseyn:** incentive.

[00:28:05] **Robbie Wagner:** incentive.

[00:28:05] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:28:06] **Robbie Wagner:** Like Elon's,

[00:28:07] **Robbie Wagner:** $1 trillion compensation thing is like

[00:28:09] **Robbie Wagner:** tied

[00:28:10] **Robbie Wagner:** to

[00:28:10] **Robbie Wagner:** specific

[00:28:10] **Robbie Wagner:** deliverables. Exactly.

[00:28:11] **Robbie Wagner:** So new

[00:28:12] **Robbie Wagner:** are tied

[00:28:12] **Robbie Wagner:** to

[00:28:12] **Taylor Desseyn:** specific

[00:28:13] **Taylor Desseyn:** deliverables at Torque. Why

[00:28:14] **Taylor Desseyn:** can't

[00:28:15] **Jason Torres:** government

[00:28:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** be tied to specific deliverables?

[00:28:17] **Jason Torres:** should deliver?

[00:28:18] **Taylor Desseyn:** chat like right now? I'd be

[00:28:19] **Robbie Wagner:** Oh, I have not, I don't know if there's any

[00:28:21] **Jason Torres:** Um,

[00:28:21] **Robbie Wagner:** Let's see.

[00:28:23] **Jason Torres:** No, '

[00:28:23] **Jason Torres:** cause I, like

[00:28:23] **Jason Torres:** I

[00:28:24] **Jason Torres:** found

[00:28:24] **Jason Torres:** out

[00:28:24] **Jason Torres:** a couple

[00:28:24] **Jason Torres:** years

[00:28:24] **Jason Torres:** ago

[00:28:25] **Jason Torres:** that

[00:28:25] **Jason Torres:** the

[00:28:25] **Jason Torres:** superintendent

[00:28:26] **Jason Torres:** of the Webster Central School District made.
$370,000 a year outta my taxpayer dollars. Like I,

[00:28:35] **Jason Torres:** I,

[00:28:35] **Jason Torres:** think

[00:28:36] **Jason Torres:** that's unreasonable when

[00:28:37] **Jason Torres:** you

[00:28:37] **Jason Torres:** have teachers who are actually doing

[00:28:39] **Jason Torres:** the work

[00:28:40] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah,

[00:28:40] **Jason Torres:** making

[00:28:41] **Jason Torres:** 40.

[00:28:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah.

[00:28:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:28:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** do have to

[00:28:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** say, I

[00:28:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** think

[00:28:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** teachers, I think

[00:28:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** now

[00:28:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** having kids,

[00:28:45] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:28:45] **Taylor Desseyn:** mean, the

[00:28:45] **Taylor Desseyn:** fact that

[00:28:45] **Taylor Desseyn:** teachers

[00:28:46] **Taylor Desseyn:** have

[00:28:46] **Taylor Desseyn:** to pay

[00:28:47] **Taylor Desseyn:** for

[00:28:47] **Taylor Desseyn:** shit

[00:28:47] **Taylor Desseyn:** outta

[00:28:47] **Taylor Desseyn:** their

[00:28:47] **Taylor Desseyn:** own

[00:28:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** pocket

[00:28:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** is wild. To

[00:28:49] **Taylor Desseyn:** me, that

[00:28:49] **Taylor Desseyn:** is

[00:28:50] **Taylor Desseyn:** unfair.

[00:28:50] **Robbie Wagner:** And

[00:28:50] **Robbie Wagner:** you gotta

[00:28:51] **Robbie Wagner:** watch

[00:28:51] **Robbie Wagner:** like 20 to

[00:28:52] **Robbie Wagner:** 30 kids

[00:28:53] **Robbie Wagner:** all

[00:28:53] **Robbie Wagner:** day.

[00:28:54] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:28:54] **Robbie Wagner:** can

[00:28:55] **Robbie Wagner:** even

[00:28:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** I mean,

[00:28:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** like

[00:28:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** watching

[00:28:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** two,

[00:28:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** two

[00:28:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** of

[00:28:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** my

[00:28:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** own

[00:28:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** almost

[00:28:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** three is

[00:28:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** hard

[00:28:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** [00:29:00] enough.

[00:29:00] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:29:01] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:29:01] **Robbie Wagner:** But like,

[00:29:01] **Robbie Wagner:** if

[00:29:02] **Robbie Wagner:** they just instead

[00:29:03] **Robbie Wagner:** did

[00:29:03] **Robbie Wagner:** daycare

[00:29:04] **Robbie Wagner:** and

[00:29:04] **Robbie Wagner:** watch

[00:29:04] **Robbie Wagner:** 20

[00:29:05] **Robbie Wagner:** kids,

[00:29:05] **Robbie Wagner:** they would

[00:29:05] **Robbie Wagner:** make

[00:29:05] **Robbie Wagner:** so

[00:29:06] **Robbie Wagner:** much money.

[00:29:06] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah.

[00:29:07] **Jason Torres:** Yeah.

[00:29:07] **Robbie Wagner:** I mean,

[00:29:07] **Taylor Desseyn:** brother

[00:30:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** random

[00:30:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** questions.

[00:30:45] **Robbie Wagner:** that on a

[00:30:45] **Robbie Wagner:** DHH

[00:30:46] **Robbie Wagner:** video

[00:30:46] **Robbie Wagner:** that

[00:30:49] **Robbie Wagner:** Uh, you a big

[00:30:49] **Robbie Wagner:** DHH

[00:30:50] **Robbie Wagner:** fan.

[00:30:50] **Jason Torres:** is

[00:30:51] **Jason Torres:** I dunno who

[00:30:51] **Jason Torres:** that is

[00:30:52] **Jason Torres:** Uh,

[00:30:52] **Jason Torres:** keep

[00:30:53] **Jason Torres:** hearing

[00:30:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** dhhs.

[00:30:54] **Robbie Wagner:** what

[00:30:54] **Jason Torres:** He's also apparently like a Formula One.

[00:30:57] **Robbie Wagner:** stand for? I couldn't

[00:30:57] **Robbie Wagner:** tell you

[00:30:58] **Jason Torres:** Dave,

[00:30:59] **Jason Torres:** [00:31:00] David something.

[00:31:00] **Jason Torres:** He's a dentist.

[00:31:01] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:31:02] **Taylor Desseyn:** okay. Cool. I used to recruit a lot of Ruby.

[00:31:04] **Jason Torres:** what

[00:31:05] **Jason Torres:** did he say?

[00:31:05] **Jason Torres:** It was something about content

[00:31:07] **Jason Torres:** like he had. Cool. No, it was great

[00:31:11] **Jason Torres:** research.

[00:31:12] **Jason Torres:** Hey,

[00:31:13] **Jason Torres:** I

[00:31:13] **Jason Torres:** like

[00:31:13] **Jason Torres:** No, no, no, no, I remember what it was. He was
talking about the term content creator and like no one is a content creator and
it's a stupid title because content isn't ingested

[00:31:24] **Jason Torres:** in the, like

[00:31:25] **Jason Torres:** he

[00:31:25] **Jason Torres:** had a

[00:31:25] **Jason Torres:** really

[00:31:25] **Jason Torres:** good

[00:31:25] **Jason Torres:** explanation

[00:31:26] **Jason Torres:** for it. And I agree

[00:31:26] **Jason Torres:** with

[00:31:27] **Jason Torres:** him

[00:31:27] **Jason Torres:** because I have such an aversion to that like term
and like influencer and stuff like that. It's, it's very cringe. That's why I
have.

[00:31:35] **Jason Torres:** I, I'll

[00:31:35] **Jason Torres:** be honest, I

[00:31:36] **Jason Torres:** struggle sometimes with how we have to like build
community because of certain things with the content that we have to create.

[00:31:44] **Jason Torres:** 'cause I think that there's a very gray area where
it becomes super disingenuous

[00:31:49] **Jason Torres:** and inauthentic. And

[00:31:51] **Jason Torres:** that

[00:31:51] **Jason Torres:** for

[00:31:51] **Jason Torres:** me,

[00:31:52] **Jason Torres:** and

[00:31:53] **Jason Torres:** I know

[00:31:53] **Jason Torres:** it is for you

[00:31:53] **Jason Torres:** too.

[00:31:53] **Jason Torres:** I'm not

[00:31:54] **Jason Torres:** like

[00:31:54] **Jason Torres:** saying

[00:31:55] **Jason Torres:** that he's different.

[00:31:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** I'm built different.

[00:31:58] **Jason Torres:** It's

[00:31:59] **Jason Torres:** hard for

[00:31:59] **Jason Torres:** me [00:32:00] because, and this goes back to
working in film, like I worked in an industry where people got paid to not be
themselves.

[00:32:06] **Jason Torres:** Yeah,

[00:32:06] **Jason Torres:** So then now for me, it's like I want to

[00:32:09] **Jason Torres:** come at this

[00:32:10] **Jason Torres:** like as organic and like I just want you to like me
for who I am actually, and I want to help you for who you are actually And it's
like, if you don't like what we're doing,

[00:32:20] **Jason Torres:** that's fine.

[00:32:20] **Jason Torres:** Move

[00:32:20] **Jason Torres:** on.

[00:32:21] **Jason Torres:** Yeah.

[00:32:21] **Jason Torres:** Like, 'cause community

[00:32:23] **Jason Torres:** can

[00:32:23] **Jason Torres:** be

[00:32:23] **Jason Torres:** everywhere and everything.

[00:32:25] **Jason Torres:** And.

[00:32:25] **Jason Torres:** it doesn't

[00:32:25] **Jason Torres:** have

[00:32:26] **Jason Torres:** to

[00:32:26] **Jason Torres:** be like

[00:32:26] **Jason Torres:** built

[00:32:27] **Jason Torres:** inauthentically. So for that

[00:32:29] **Jason Torres:** like

[00:32:29] **Jason Torres:** content

[00:32:30] **Jason Torres:** creation point that he

[00:32:30] **Jason Torres:** was making,

[00:32:31] **Jason Torres:** for

[00:32:31] **Jason Torres:** me it

[00:32:31] **Jason Torres:** was

[00:32:31] **Jason Torres:** like,

[00:32:32] **Jason Torres:** it

[00:32:32] **Jason Torres:** resonated

[00:32:33] **Jason Torres:** because

[00:32:33] **Jason Torres:** I

[00:32:33] **Jason Torres:** agree

[00:32:34] **Jason Torres:** with his

[00:32:34] **Jason Torres:** thought, like

[00:32:35] **Jason Torres:** everybody

[00:32:35] **Jason Torres:** creates

[00:32:36] **Jason Torres:** content,

[00:32:37] **Jason Torres:** but

[00:32:37] **Jason Torres:** it's not,

[00:32:37] **Jason Torres:** it's

[00:32:38] **Jason Torres:** organic, it

[00:32:38] **Jason Torres:** doesn't

[00:32:39] **Jason Torres:** have to

[00:32:39] **Jason Torres:** be

[00:32:39] **Jason Torres:** branded as

[00:32:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah.

[00:32:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** I, I mean, listen, I mean, this is

[00:32:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** the first

[00:32:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** time

[00:32:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** I've managed,

[00:32:45] **Taylor Desseyn:** well, I'm

[00:32:46] **Taylor Desseyn:** gonna be honest with you, this is the first time
I've truly managed and I'm not even truly managing because like we, we have a
very small team,

[00:32:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** I can

[00:32:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** see

[00:32:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** why Dere teams get fired easily.

[00:32:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** but

[00:32:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** I'll

[00:32:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** also tell

[00:32:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** you this,

[00:32:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** and Jason and

[00:32:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:32:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** have had these, a lot of [00:33:00]
conversations, off the record and, backstage, whatever you wanna call it, I give
a lot of props to torque in the leadership with Mike Morris, Dave Messinger, and
Pat Griffin.

[00:33:11] **Taylor Desseyn:** They

[00:33:11] **Taylor Desseyn:** just want us to cook. And for us, like that's
huge.

[00:33:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** And, But

[00:33:16] **Taylor Desseyn:** I agree with Jason. I think

[00:33:18] **Taylor Desseyn:** I think what

[00:33:18] **Taylor Desseyn:** we've

[00:33:18] **Taylor Desseyn:** been able to

[00:33:19] **Taylor Desseyn:** build

[00:33:19] **Taylor Desseyn:** and showed us

[00:33:19] **Taylor Desseyn:** such

[00:33:20] **Taylor Desseyn:** a short

[00:33:21] **Taylor Desseyn:** time

[00:33:22] **Taylor Desseyn:** is

[00:33:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** because

[00:33:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** of

[00:33:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** the authenticity

[00:33:24] **Taylor Desseyn:** that

[00:33:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** we've

[00:33:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** been able

[00:33:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** to keep throughout. Like, we've

[00:33:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** only

[00:33:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** had a

[00:33:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** few

[00:33:28] **Taylor Desseyn:** side

[00:33:28] **Taylor Desseyn:** quests that

[00:33:29] **Taylor Desseyn:** have

[00:33:29] **Taylor Desseyn:** been

[00:33:29] **Taylor Desseyn:** inauthentic,

[00:33:31] **Jason Torres:** Guidewire. Yeah.

[00:33:32] **Jason Torres:** Guidewire.

[00:33:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah, yeah. We

[00:33:34] **Robbie Wagner:** I

[00:33:34] **Jason Torres:** no, I

[00:33:34] **Jason Torres:** full

[00:33:35] **Jason Torres:** transparency. I mean, we,

[00:33:36] **Jason Torres:** we have been asked

[00:33:37] **Jason Torres:** by like

[00:33:37] **Jason Torres:** certain departments to

[00:33:38] **Jason Torres:** like,

[00:33:38] **Jason Torres:** produce

[00:33:39] **Jason Torres:** certain

[00:33:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yep.

[00:33:40] **Jason Torres:** Yeah.

[00:33:40] **Jason Torres:** And

[00:33:41] **Jason Torres:** you gotta

[00:33:41] **Jason Torres:** do

[00:33:41] **Jason Torres:** it

[00:33:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah. it's

[00:33:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** part

[00:33:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** of

[00:33:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** the

[00:33:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** job.

[00:33:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah.

[00:33:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** it

[00:33:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** doesn't mean

[00:33:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** that which by the way,

[00:33:45] **Taylor Desseyn:** we

[00:33:45] **Taylor Desseyn:** are

[00:33:45] **Taylor Desseyn:** hiring a Java dev rail person.

[00:33:47] **Taylor Desseyn:** I'm gonna say

[00:33:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** it publicly.

[00:33:49] **Taylor Desseyn:** by the way, my mom texted me,

[00:33:51] **Taylor Desseyn:** said she watched it. Is

[00:33:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** she?

[00:33:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah.

[00:33:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** Uh,

[00:33:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** and, and, uh, so we are hiring a Java dev rail
person to come help educate, help our community.

[00:33:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** but

[00:33:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** it's

[00:33:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** [00:34:00] like what Jason

[00:34:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** said, like, we've

[00:34:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** been

[00:34:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** really authentic.

[00:34:02] **Taylor Desseyn:** And

[00:34:02] **Taylor Desseyn:** to be

[00:34:02] **Taylor Desseyn:** honest

[00:34:02] **Taylor Desseyn:** with

[00:34:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** you,

[00:34:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:34:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** would

[00:34:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** say

[00:34:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** what we've been able to build in a year is, is,

[00:34:06] **Taylor Desseyn:** pretty

[00:34:06] **Taylor Desseyn:** tremendous.

[00:34:07] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah, I think it's, it's like acquiring a company
and just letting them continue to do what you acquired them for versus like

[00:34:13] **Jason Torres:** being oh, I own you now, so you change everything.

[00:34:16] **Robbie Wagner:** It's like, why would you do that if you thought
they were doing well enough to buy them

[00:34:20] **Robbie Wagner:** Let them do what they do.

[00:34:21] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah.

[00:34:22] **Taylor Desseyn:** Yeah.

[00:34:22] **Robbie Wagner:** to make people fit into some box doesn't ever
work.

[00:34:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** No,

[00:34:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** it doesn't. And, and, and I think, again, I think
I know Mike Morris at the top, , our CEO is, doing the Lord's work. And, we do
have a new boss. His name's Pat Griffin. He's a double Harvard grad. Dude's a g
, Bain and McKenzie, former Bain and McKen. I mean, he is like,

[00:34:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** his

[00:34:40] **Taylor Desseyn:** mentality, I'm

[00:34:41] **Taylor Desseyn:** gonna say it here

[00:34:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** ,

[00:34:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** And Jason and I

[00:34:42] **Taylor Desseyn:** kind

[00:34:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** of

[00:34:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** like it to be honest with you.

[00:34:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** He

[00:34:44] **Taylor Desseyn:** goes,

[00:34:45] **Taylor Desseyn:** why

[00:34:45] **Taylor Desseyn:** the

[00:34:45] **Taylor Desseyn:** fuck would anybody want to be a part of us?

[00:34:47] **Taylor Desseyn:** He

[00:34:47] **Taylor Desseyn:** was

[00:34:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** like,

[00:34:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** we

[00:34:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** need

[00:34:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** to

[00:34:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** give

[00:34:49] **Taylor Desseyn:** them

[00:34:49] **Taylor Desseyn:** enough

[00:34:50] **Taylor Desseyn:** proof

[00:34:51] **Taylor Desseyn:** and enough

[00:34:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** value

[00:34:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** to

[00:34:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** where they

[00:34:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** want to come and be a part of us. And

[00:34:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** honestly,

[00:34:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:34:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** love

[00:34:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** that.

[00:34:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** And

[00:34:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** that's

[00:34:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** what

[00:34:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** we're

[00:34:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** trying

[00:34:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** to

[00:34:56] **Taylor Desseyn:** chase.

[00:34:57] **Taylor Desseyn:** Always,

[00:34:58] **Taylor Desseyn:** always

[00:34:58] **Jason Torres:** provide everybody. [00:35:00] the

[00:35:00] **Jason Torres:** harder

[00:35:01] **Jason Torres:** task

[00:35:01] **Jason Torres:** for us, and we've had this conversation before,

[00:35:04] **Jason Torres:** we

[00:35:04] **Jason Torres:** don't

[00:35:04] **Jason Torres:** have a product, like we're

[00:35:05] **Jason Torres:** not a framework

[00:35:07] **Jason Torres:** or a

[00:35:07] **Taylor Desseyn:** we do. I mean, we

[00:35:09] **Jason Torres:** a tool. do.

[00:35:10] **Jason Torres:** but we will soon,

[00:35:12] **Jason Torres:** But the, but

[00:35:13] **Jason Torres:** the thing is can really jobs

[00:35:15] **Jason Torres:** it, it makes it,

[00:35:16] **Jason Torres:** it

[00:35:17] **Jason Torres:** almost

[00:35:17] **Jason Torres:** makes

[00:35:17] **Jason Torres:** our

[00:35:17] **Jason Torres:** jobs

[00:35:18] **Jason Torres:** harder

[00:35:18] **Jason Torres:** and more unique in the sense

[00:35:20] **Jason Torres:** that, like

[00:35:20] **Jason Torres:** how

[00:35:21] **Jason Torres:** do you get

[00:35:21] **Jason Torres:** people to get on board for a, thought or a theory
or like,

[00:35:25] **Taylor Desseyn:** I mean,

[00:35:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** I mean

[00:35:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** vibes to the

[00:35:28] **Taylor Desseyn:** truest consent. we

[00:35:29] **Taylor Desseyn:** are releasing the platform, so the platform's
coming. It's dropping at the end of the month. And basically our whole goal is
we're gonna have multiple different facets. Right?

[00:35:37] **Taylor Desseyn:** So Ken, our head of product, Ken Collins, he's
developing kind of this perfect fit jobs where if you sign on

[00:35:45] **Taylor Desseyn:** tailored jobs that are a fit for you on our
platform.

[00:35:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** Then we're in

[00:35:49] **Taylor Desseyn:** charge of all the content and then there's gonna
be a lot. And then kind of the next evolution is like. Our AI's gonna tell you,
Hey, you're not being matched with a lot of jobs because you're missing

[00:35:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** this

[00:35:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** [00:36:00] piece

[00:36:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** in your

[00:36:00] **Taylor Desseyn:** career. You should help.

you.

[00:36:05] **Taylor Desseyn:** But

[00:36:06] **Taylor Desseyn:** that's

[00:36:06] **Taylor Desseyn:** not dropped yet. I mean, right now it's like sign
up to our platform and you're gonna get impossibly matched by a Ronstadt
recruiter. But once this new

[00:36:16] **Taylor Desseyn:** product

[00:36:16] **Taylor Desseyn:** drops, we'll

[00:36:17] **Taylor Desseyn:** have

[00:36:17] **Taylor Desseyn:** lot

[00:36:17] **Taylor Desseyn:** there.

[00:37:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** be building

[00:37:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** Like,

[00:37:10] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:37:10] **Taylor Desseyn:** mean,

[00:37:11] **Taylor Desseyn:** I've

[00:37:11] **Taylor Desseyn:** said it from

[00:37:11] **Taylor Desseyn:** the GetGo. I think

[00:37:12] **Taylor Desseyn:** every company

[00:37:13] **Taylor Desseyn:** needs

[00:37:13] **Taylor Desseyn:** to

[00:37:13] **Taylor Desseyn:** view themselves as a media company,

[00:37:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** every

[00:37:15] **Taylor Desseyn:** company,

[00:37:16] **Taylor Desseyn:** right?

[00:37:16] **Taylor Desseyn:** I think sin

[00:37:18] **Taylor Desseyn:** that,

[00:37:18] **Taylor Desseyn:** no,

[00:37:18] **Jason Torres:** would've, That

[00:37:18] **Jason Torres:** would've, been it,

[00:37:19] **Taylor Desseyn:** that, was

[00:37:20] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:37:20] **Taylor Desseyn:** think,

[00:37:21] **Taylor Desseyn:** I think every

[00:37:21] **Taylor Desseyn:** company,

[00:37:22] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:37:22] **Taylor Desseyn:** mean literally

[00:37:22] **Taylor Desseyn:** like,

[00:37:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** every

[00:37:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** company

[00:37:23] **Taylor Desseyn:** should

[00:37:24] **Taylor Desseyn:** aspire

[00:37:24] **Taylor Desseyn:** to be like Barstool Sports.

[00:37:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** In

[00:37:26] **Taylor Desseyn:** a sense

[00:37:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** of

[00:37:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** you

[00:37:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** have

[00:37:27] **Taylor Desseyn:** multiple

[00:37:28] **Taylor Desseyn:** different personalities, multiple different
podcasts.

[00:37:30] **Taylor Desseyn:** I mean,

[00:37:31] **Taylor Desseyn:** that's

[00:37:32] **Taylor Desseyn:** yeah,

[00:37:33] **Taylor Desseyn:** that's not, that's not quite the point. But, You
know, but I mean, century buying Syntax fm brilliant,

[00:37:39] **Taylor Desseyn:** right? Like, honestly, again, like. Who I

[00:37:41] **Taylor Desseyn:** hire. Like they're

[00:37:43] **Taylor Desseyn:** gonna have to have a podcast like you have to
produce media in today's world to be known.

[00:37:47] **Taylor Desseyn:** And I think,

[00:37:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:37:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** think

[00:37:48] **Taylor Desseyn:** the timeline is

[00:37:49] **Taylor Desseyn:** shrinking

[00:37:50] **Taylor Desseyn:** right

[00:37:50] **Taylor Desseyn:** now with all the

[00:37:51] **Taylor Desseyn:** SOAR videos.

[00:37:52] **Taylor Desseyn:** I mean, Clark put out another

[00:37:53] **Taylor Desseyn:** one. I mean, riding into our,

[00:37:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** did you see

[00:37:55] **Taylor Desseyn:** it riding a horse into,

[00:37:58] **Jason Torres:** Were you guys drinking milkshakes?

[00:37:59] **Taylor Desseyn:** [00:38:00] know what it was.

[00:38:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** So,

[00:38:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:38:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** mean,

[00:38:01] **Taylor Desseyn:** but

[00:38:02] **Taylor Desseyn:** again, like the AI slop,

[00:38:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** like

[00:38:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** I

[00:38:03] **Taylor Desseyn:** think

[00:38:04] **Taylor Desseyn:** the window. To gain market share through organic
content is shrinking.

[00:38:08] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah.

[00:38:08] **Taylor Desseyn:** think

[00:38:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** we

[00:38:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** got

[00:38:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** about

[00:38:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** three

[00:38:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** to five

[00:38:09] **Taylor Desseyn:** years left.

[00:38:11] **Jason Torres:** I don't even think it's that

[00:38:12] **Jason Torres:** long. No,

[00:38:13] **Jason Torres:** And it, because we're getting so much shitty AI
slop that it's

[00:38:18] **Jason Torres:** gonna

[00:38:18] **Jason Torres:** be

[00:38:18] **Jason Torres:** iterated on very quickly. all the bad stuff is what
generates the good stuff. Yeah. Eventually. Yeah. So it's

[00:38:24] **Jason Torres:** just, it's

[00:38:26] **Jason Torres:** now

[00:38:26] **Jason Torres:** happening.

[00:38:26] **Jason Torres:** It's

[00:38:27] **Jason Torres:** gonna

[00:38:27] **Jason Torres:** roll

[00:38:27] **Jason Torres:** out so.

[00:38:28] **Jason Torres:** exponentially

[00:38:29] **Jason Torres:** that it will start

[00:38:30] **Jason Torres:** getting good faster than I think a lot of us are
anticipating.

[00:38:32] **Jason Torres:** It's the

[00:38:32] **Jason Torres:** same thing

[00:38:32] **Jason Torres:** with

[00:38:33] **Jason Torres:** the

[00:38:33] **Jason Torres:** AI coding

[00:38:34] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah. They've really

[00:38:36] **Robbie Wagner:** exponentially.

[00:38:37] **Robbie Wagner:** gotten

[00:38:37] **Robbie Wagner:** better.

[00:38:38] **Robbie Wagner:** Yeah.

[00:38:38] **Robbie Wagner:** Because

[00:38:39] **Robbie Wagner:** I could

[00:38:39] **Robbie Wagner:** do

[00:38:40] **Robbie Wagner:** absolutely

[00:38:40] **Robbie Wagner:** nothing with

[00:38:40] **Robbie Wagner:** AI for like.

[00:38:42] **Robbie Wagner:** Everyone's like, oh, I one

[00:38:42] **Robbie Wagner:** shot

[00:38:43] **Robbie Wagner:** of this app. Like,

[00:38:43] **Robbie Wagner:** no, you fucking

[00:38:44] **Robbie Wagner:** didn't.

[00:38:44] **Robbie Wagner:** Like

[00:38:45] **Robbie Wagner:** you wrote

[00:38:45] **Robbie Wagner:** that

[00:38:45] **Robbie Wagner:** app.

[00:38:45] **Robbie Wagner:** And

[00:38:45] **Robbie Wagner:** then

[00:38:46] **Robbie Wagner:** like

[00:38:46] **Robbie Wagner:** typed in Make me app. I'm like, whoa, look what it
made like. But now it's

[00:38:51] **Robbie Wagner:** like,

[00:38:51] **Robbie Wagner:** I don't

[00:38:52] **Robbie Wagner:** know, with the agent stuff

[00:38:53] **Robbie Wagner:** that can just

[00:38:53] **Jason Torres:** keep rolling.

[00:38:54] **Robbie Wagner:** rolling

[00:38:54] **Jason Torres:** it

[00:38:55] **Jason Torres:** like,

[00:38:55] **Jason Torres:** yeah,

[00:38:56] **Robbie Wagner:** as

[00:38:56] **Robbie Wagner:** long as it doesn't get mega

[00:38:57] **Robbie Wagner:** stuck,

[00:38:58] **Robbie Wagner:** it'll just

[00:38:58] **Robbie Wagner:** go,

[00:38:58] **Robbie Wagner:** oh

[00:38:58] **Robbie Wagner:** yeah,

[00:38:58] **Robbie Wagner:** that

[00:38:59] **Robbie Wagner:** doesn't work.

[00:38:59] **Robbie Wagner:** And then [00:39:00] Like change

[00:39:00] **Robbie Wagner:** itself.

[00:39:00] **Jason Torres:** Yeah.

[00:39:02] **Robbie Wagner:** it's,

[00:39:02] **Robbie Wagner:** it's

[00:39:02] **Robbie Wagner:** gotten a

[00:39:02] **Robbie Wagner:** lot

[00:39:03] **Robbie Wagner:** better

[00:39:03] **Robbie Wagner:** and I

[00:39:03] **Robbie Wagner:** can

[00:39:03] **Robbie Wagner:** actually do

[00:39:04] **Robbie Wagner:** some

[00:39:04] **Robbie Wagner:** things with it instead of

[00:39:05] **Robbie Wagner:** zero things

[00:39:06] **Robbie Wagner:** with it. So I'm

[00:39:06] **Jason Torres:** I'm very

[00:39:07] **Jason Torres:** curious to see,

[00:39:08] **Jason Torres:** cause code rabbits here.

[00:39:09] **Jason Torres:** I've never used Third product. Are you

[00:39:11] **Jason Torres:** familiar?

[00:39:12] **Jason Torres:** just from

[00:39:12] **Jason Torres:** what

[00:39:12] **Jason Torres:** they

[00:39:12] **Jason Torres:** told us

[00:39:13] **Jason Torres:** last

[00:39:13] **Jason Torres:** night.

[00:39:13] **Jason Torres:** Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

[00:39:15] **Jason Torres:** No,

[00:39:15] **Jason Torres:** but I

[00:39:15] **Jason Torres:** mean, based

[00:39:16] **Jason Torres:** on

[00:39:16] **Jason Torres:** that

[00:39:16] **Jason Torres:** demo,

[00:39:16] **Jason Torres:** I

[00:39:16] **Jason Torres:** was like,

[00:39:17] **Jason Torres:** okay, like

[00:39:17] **Jason Torres:** I,

[00:39:17] **Jason Torres:** I

[00:39:17] **Jason Torres:** could see

[00:39:18] **Jason Torres:** a benefit to this. And again, it's like

[00:39:20] **Jason Torres:** finding AI

[00:39:21] **Jason Torres:** or

[00:39:21] **Jason Torres:** areas

[00:39:22] **Jason Torres:** in

[00:39:22] **Jason Torres:** your

[00:39:22] **Jason Torres:** work

[00:39:22] **Jason Torres:** that

[00:39:23] **Jason Torres:** AI

[00:39:23] **Jason Torres:** makes

[00:39:23] **Jason Torres:** sense.

[00:39:24] **Jason Torres:** Like I feel like that That's a

[00:39:26] **Jason Torres:** good one.

[00:39:26] **Jason Torres:** Yeah.
