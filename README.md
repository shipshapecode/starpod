# Starpod

Starpod is the easiest way to create a podcast website in 5 minutes or less and
it is 100% free and open source.

### Configuration

You will need to configure your RSS feed and a few other pieces of info for your
podcast in starpod.config.mjs. We provide a util function `defineStarpodConfig`
that provides TypeScript types and enforces the correct formats for config
values.

An example config can be found [here](./starpod.config.ts).

#### Options

##### blurb

A very short tagline for your show. Generally, no more than one sentence. Less
is more here.

**Example:**

```ts
blurb: 'A whiskey fueled fireside chat with your favorite web developers.',
```

##### description

A somewhat longer description of what your show is about. This should still
ideally be fairly short, and should usually be 2-4 sentences.

**Example:**

```ts
description:
  'Veteran web developers RobbieTheWagner and Charles William Carpenter III host this informal, whiskey-fueled fireside chat with your favorite web devs. They discuss all things web development including JavaScript, TypeScript, EmberJS, React, Astro, SolidJS, CSS, HTML, Web3, and more. They take a unique approach and focus on getting to know the human side of developers and their hobbies outside of work, all while sampling a new whiskey that they rate on their unique tentacle scale.',
```

##### hosts

A list of your show's hosts and their info.

**Example:**

```ts
hosts: [
  {
    name: 'RobbieTheWagner',
    bio: 'Huge Ember and Tailwind fanboy. I work at Amazon btw.',
    img: '/src/img/robbiethewagner.jpg',
    github: 'https://github.com/RobbieTheWagner',
    twitter: 'https://twitter.com/RobbieTheWagner',
    website: 'https://robbiethewagner.dev'
  },
  {
    name: 'Charles William Carpenter III',
    bio: 'Third of his name, user of gifs, hater of ESM.',
    img: '/src/img/chuckcarpenter.jpg',
    github: 'https://github.com/chuckcarpenter',
    twitter: 'https://twitter.com/CharlesWthe3rd'
  }
],
```

##### platforms

Links to the platforms your show is available on.

**Example:**

```ts
platforms: {
  apple:
    'https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/whiskey-web-and-whatnot/id1552776603?uo=4?mt=2&ls=1',
  overcast: 'https://overcast.fm/itunes1552776603',
  spotify: 'https://open.spotify.com/show/19jiuHAqzeKnkleQUpZxDf',
  youtube: 'https://www.youtube.com/@WhiskeyWebAndWhatnot/'
},
```

##### rssFeed

The url to the RSS feed where your podcast is hosted.

**Example:**

```ts
rssFeed: 'https://anchor.fm/s/e329dea0/podcast/rss';
```

#### Setting up the contact form

The contact form hits an APIRoute at `/api/contact`. It is currently configured
to send the form data to a Slack channel webhook I had setup. It reads the url
from `import.meta.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK`, so if you define a `SLACK_WEBHOOK`
environment variable it should work for you. Of course, feel free to customize
the code [here](./src/pages/api/contact.ts) to send the data elsewhere as you
see fit.

#### Configuring guests

We use Turso and Astro DB to setup guests per episode. If you would also like to do this, you will need a Turso account.
